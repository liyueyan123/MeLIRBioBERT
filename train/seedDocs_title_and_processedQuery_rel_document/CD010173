The study group included 204 people in the Vancouver Downtown Eastside (DTES). This was shown to be a high-risk community based on risk factors, lack of access to care, and the high frequency of oral mucosal anomalies. Acceptance of screening was high (98%); however, acceptance of biopsy for abnormal findings and follow-up was low. Among the 12 patients with clinical leukoplakia who were biopsied, 10 showed cancer or precancer. In summary, these data show a need for screening in this population and an ability to recruit patients to screening. They support a future expansion of this initiative to create a more comprehensive strategy for outreach to this underserved community that extends to screening, diagnostic work-up, and treatment.
