Recurrences occurred in 13 patients: seven asymptomatic and six symptomatic. CT scans, obtained in 10 of these 13 patients, were positive in nine. Liver function tests were not elevated in any and carcinoembryonic antigen was abnormal in six of 11 patients. CT is the most sensitive test for the detection of recurrent disease.
