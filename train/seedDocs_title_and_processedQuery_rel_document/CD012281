They underwent transvaginal ultrasonography and measurement of CA 19.9 and CA 125 plasma levels within 2 days before surgery. The ultrasonographic impression and the tumor marker values were compared with the histopathologic diagnosis. The overall agreement between the test result and the actual outcome was calculated using the kappa statistic.Transvaginal ultrasonography had a strong agreement between test result and surgery (kappa value 0.84), whereas the combined methods were associated with a lower kappa value (range 0.24-0.80).Transvaginal ultrasonography used alone is the most cost-effective method in the preoperative differential diagnosis of endometrioma.
