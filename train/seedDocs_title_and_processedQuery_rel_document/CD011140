Methods were similar to those described in the one-year results, with follow-up visits continuing at 18 and 24 months. Main outcome measures included BCVA change from baseline, endothelial cell density (ECD) and morphometry, and incidence of complications.At two years, data from 174 (92.6%) of 188 available patients were analyzed. Overall, 103 (59.5%) of 173 telescope-implanted eyes gained three lines or more (doubling of visual angle) of BCVA compared with 18 (10.3%) of 174 fellow control eyes (P < .0001). Mean BCVA improved 3.6 lines (standard deviation [SD], 1.9 lines) and 2.8 lines (SD, 2.3 lines) from baseline in eyes with the 3X and 2.2X device models, respectively. Mean ECD stabilized through two years, with 2.4% mean cell loss occurring from one to two years. There was no significant change in coefficient of variation or percentage of hexagonal endothelial cells from within six months to two years after surgery. The most common complication was inflammatory deposits.Long-term results of this telescope prosthesis show the substantial BCVA improvement at one year is maintained at two years. Key indicators of corneal health demonstrate ECD change that reflects remodeling of the endothelium associated with the implantation procedure. ECD stabilizes over time, and there is no evidence of any ongoing endothelial trauma.
