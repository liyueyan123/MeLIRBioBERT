Postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF) was defined and classified by the international study group of pancreatic fistula (ISGPF). We used a logistic regression model to determine the independent risk factors of CR-POPF and developed a scoring system based on the regression coefficient of the logistic regression model. The optimal cut-off value to divide the risk strata was determined by the Youden index. The patients were divided into two groups (low risk and high risk). The independent sample t test was used to detect differences in the means of drain amylase on postoperative day (POD) 1, 2 and 3. The optimal cut-off level of the drain amylase to distinguish CR-POPF from non-clinical POPF in the two risk strata groups was determined using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves.Grade A POPF occurred in 106 (11.5%) patients, grade B occurred in 57 (6.2%) patients, and grade C occurred in 32 (3.5%) patients. A predictive scoring system for CR-POPF (0-6 points) was constructed using the following four factors: 1 point for each body mass index ≥ 28 [odds ratio (OR) = 3.86; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.92-7.75, P = 0.00], soft gland texture (OR = 4.50; 95%CI, 2.53-7.98, P = 0.00), and the difference between the blood loss and transfusion in operation ≥ 800 mL (OR = 3.45; 95%CI, 1.92-7.75, P = 0.00); and from 0 points for a 5 mm or greater duct diameter to 3 points for a less than 2 mm duct (OR = 8.97; 95%CI: 3.70-21.77, P = 0.00). The ROC curve showed that the area under the curve of this score was 0.812. A score of 3 points was suggested to be the best cut-off value (Youden index = 0.485). In the low risk group, a drain amylase level ≥ 3600 U/L on POD3 could distinguish CR-POPF from non-clinical POPF (the sensitivity and specificity were 75% and 85%, respectively). In the high risk group, the best cut-off was a drain amylase level of 1600 (the sensitivity and specificity were 77 and 63%, respectively).A 6-point scoring system accurately predicted the occurrence of CR-POPF. In addition, a drain amylase level on POD3 might be a predictor of this complication.
