The OCT features were categorized into: type 1, sponge-like retinal swelling; type 2, cystoid macular edema; type 3, serous retinal detachment; and type 4, vitreofoveal traction.The CMT in eyes with diabetic macular edema was significantly higher than in eyes of healthy controls or in eyes of diabetic patients without retinopathy (P < 0.001). Visual acuity correlated with CMT in diabetic macular edema (r = 0.558, P < 0.001). The prevalence of OCT type 1 was significantly higher in eyes with mild-to-moderate non-proliferative retinopathy (NPDR) than in eyes with severe NPDR to proliferative retinopathy (PDR) (P = 0.0069). The prevalence of OCT types 3 and 4 was significantly higher in eyes with severe NPDR to PDR than in eyes with mild-to-moderate NPDR (P = 0.0056). OCT type 1 showed the least CMT (P < 0.001) and the best visual acuity (P = 0.002).There was a significant correlation between OCT patterns of clinically significant diabetic macular edema and severity of retinopathy, CMT, and visual acuity.
