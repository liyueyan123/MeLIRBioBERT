The ducts of the other 52 patients with CBDSs were successfully cleared by preoperative or postoperative ERCP.Laparoscopic IOCG is successful in detecting CBDS in high-risk patients and half of these ducts can be cleared laparoscopically. The incidence of CBDS in low-risk patients is 1.7%, a risk that does not warrant routine cholangiography. These data suggest ERCP should be reserved for those at-risk individuals in whom IOCG or laparoscopic duct clearance has been unsuccessful.
