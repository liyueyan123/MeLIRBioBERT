These diagnosis methods were used for the first time in a Tunisian prospective study to estimate the prevalence of MP infection in children and to evaluate their usefulness for diagnosis. A total of 540 children hospitalized in Tunis for lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) between 2005 and 2009 and 580 clinical specimens were investigated for the presence of MP by culture and by end-point polymerase chain reaction (PCR) targeting the P1 and the 16S rRNA genes. Real-time PCR was also used for MP detection on 158 respiratory samples. A total of 525 serum samples were tested for detection of MP-specific IgM and IgG. The P1 adhesin type and the antibiotic susceptibility testing were determined for the 9 clinical strains isolated during the study period. MP was detected in 33 (5.7%) clinical samples. Specific MP seropositivity was confirmed in 54 serum samples (10.3%), among which 19 (3.6%) were indicative of acute MP infection. MP infection was confirmed in 39 (7.2%) patients: 24 positive by PCR and/or culture, 10 serologically positive only, and 5 confirmed positive by both methods. MP infections occurred throughout the year with a slight decrease in autumn. The 9 MP isolates were susceptible to erythromycin, tetracycline, and ciprofloxacin, and all belonged to type I. The prevalence of MP infection in children with LRTI was 7.2% between 2005 and 2009, in Tunisia. Combination of direct detection and serology was required to enhance the clinical sensitivity of MP detection in clinical specimens.
