However, as radiological techniques have improved the value of this invasive staging technique has decreased, with some units either being more selective or abandoning it altogether for certain tumour types. The aim of the present study is to prospectively evaluate the additional utility of LS of upper gastrointestinal malignancy after radiological staging with modern techniques.One hundred and six consecutive patients assessed as having potentially curable upper gastrointestinal malignancy after radiological staging underwent LS between April 1999 and June 2001. Laparoscopic findings, outcome at laparotomy and complications were prospectively recorded.Laparoscopic staging detected incurable disease in 28 of the 106 patients (26%). The negative likelihood ratio was 0.36 (95% CI 0.24-0.53). Twenty-seven patients were considered incurable because of findings at laparoscopy and one on the findings of laparoscopic ultrasound. Ten patients underwent open palliative procedures and seven had non-therapeutic laparotomies giving a non-curative laparotomy rate of 16%. LS was most useful for primary liver and biliary tract tumours and was least useful for colorectal liver metastases. The most frequent findings denoting incurability were the presence of liver disease (12 cases) and peritoneal metastases (nine cases). Complications occurred in three patients with one death being attributable in part to the laparoscopy.Laparoscopy was useful in decreasing the number of non-therapeutic laparotomies, but laparoscopic ultrasound gave little additional benefit. The utility of LS was dependent on tumour type and in particular was of marginal benefit for colorectal liver metastases. LS remains a useful staging tool but should be applied selectively.
