Findings were categorized under the image appearance and relative kidney uptake (RKU) and related to the grade of VUR, sex and child's age.MCU revealed VUR (78 unilateral and 40 bilateral) of grades I, II, III, IV and V in 2, 47, 35, 19 and 15 patients respectively. There were 52 children with normal and 66 with abnormal DMSA finding. Scarring rate was significantly associated with high grade VUR (p=0.0023) and male gender ( p=0.0412). Bilateral scarring was seen exclusively in children with bilateral VUR. No significant difference was found between renal scarring and child's age in the same gender group. Poor kidney function was shown in 5 patients.Renal scarring highly correlated with grade of VUR. A strategy to perform MCU only on patients with abnormal DMSA finding is proposed.
