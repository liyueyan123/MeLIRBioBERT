For 2D-SHG, sensitivity was 0.70 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.49-0.85), specificity was 1.0 (95% CI, 0.96-1.0), PPV was 1.0 (95% CI, 0.79-1.0), NPV was 0.95 (95% CI, 0.9-0.97), and accuracy was 95.5%. For 3D-SHG, sensitivity was 0.92 (95% CI, 0.74-0.98), specificity was 1.0 (95% CI, 0.97-1.0), PPV was 1.0 (05% CI, 0.83-1.0), NPV was 0.98 (95% CI, 0.95-0.99), and accuracy was 98.8%. For OH, sensitivity was 1.0 (95% CI, 0.85-1.0), specificity was 1.0 (95% CI, 0.97-1.0), PPV was 1.0 (95% CI, 0.84-1.0), NPV was 1.0 (0.97-1.0), and accuracy was 100%. Thus, 3D-SHG is comparable to OH in diagnosing intrauterine lesions (p = .23), and both are superior to 2D-SHG (p <0.001).The diagnostic value of 3D-SHG is comparable to OH in detecting intrauterine lesions, and both are superior to 2 D-SHG. 3D-SHG should be included in the infertility workup even in women with a normal uterine cavity at transvaginal ultrasound or hysterosalpingography.
