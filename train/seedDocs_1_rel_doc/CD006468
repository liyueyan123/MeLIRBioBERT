Thrombosis: the major Hickman catheter complication in patients with solid tumor.Major complications of Hickman catheter placement (thrombosis and infection) were determined in 168 patients with solid tumor (lung, 79; head and neck, 56; esophagus, 24; and miscellaneous, 9). Catheter-related thrombosis was clinically detected in 22 individuals and was detected at autopsy in six (total 17 percent). The 17 percent figure underestimates the true incidence of thrombosis since only 25 percent of study patients had autopsies. Patients with adenocarcinoma of the lung constituted a high risk group. Nine of 20 (45 percent) of these patients had thrombosis compared to 25, 9, and 16 percent of patients with squamous cell cancers of lung, head and neck and esophagus, respectively (p less than 0.002). Three patients with thrombosis had pulmonary emboli and two died. Thrombosis occurred despite daily heparin catheter flushing. INfections occurred in 11 patients. One had suspected endocarditis, one had a subcutaneous tunnel infection, and nine had exit site infections. All responded to local or systemic antibiotics. Better methods to prevent thrombosis are needed.
