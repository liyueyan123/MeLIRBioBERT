The application of botulinum toxin in the prostate.Botulinum neurotoxin is the most potent naturally occurring toxin known to inhibit various neurotransmitters. Injection of botulinum neurotoxin into the bladder and urethral sphincter has been used to treat bladder hyperactivity and sphincter dyssynergia. Recently botulinum neurotoxin application was extended to prostate disorders. Why would a urologist want to target the prostate?We reviewed the literature on the mechanisms of action and clinical efficacy of botulinum neurotoxin treatment of the prostate. In addition to our personal clinical experience and basic research, information was gathered from MEDLINE and published abstracts from international meetings. We also present basic research and discuss the potential mechanism of action of botulinum neurotoxin on the prostate.There are 8 current peer reviewed publications on the injection of botulinum neurotoxin in the prostate. Cystoscopic transurethral or transperineal/transrectal ultrasound guided techniques have been used. Outcome improvement reported includes decreases in prostate size, prostate specific antigen and residual urine volume, and improvement in the flow rate and symptom score lasting 6 months or longer.Botulinum toxin has demonstrated exciting and promising preliminary results for male lower urinary tract symptoms. Translational research suggests novel mechanism of action of botulinum toxin in the prostate for benign prostatic hyperplasia and chronic nonbacterial prostatitis. It may even be considered as adjuvant treatment for prostate cancer. The use of botulinum neurotoxin in the prostate is currently Food and Drug Administration off label and in support of evidence based medicine practices caution should be applied until larger, randomized clinical studies are completed. More basic research is needed to identify the mechanisms by which botulinum toxin affects the prostate.
