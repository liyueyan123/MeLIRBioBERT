Detection of recurrent rectosigmoid carcinoma: prospective evaluation of CT and clinical factors.Twenty-nine patients who underwent curative resection for rectosigmoid carcinoma were followed for 1-4 years by history and physical examination, computed tomography, liver function tests, and carcinoembryonic antigen levels. Recurrences occurred in 13 patients: seven asymptomatic and six symptomatic. CT scans, obtained in 10 of these 13 patients, were positive in nine. Liver function tests were not elevated in any and carcinoembryonic antigen was abnormal in six of 11 patients. CT is the most sensitive test for the detection of recurrent disease.
