Short-term effects of intravitreal ranibizumab and bevacizumab administration on 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring recordings in normotensive patients with age-related macular degeneration.PurposeTo evaluate effects of intravitreal ranibizumab and bevacizumab administration on ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) recordings in normotensive patients with age-related macular degeneration (AMD).Patients and methodsA total of 72 patients (mean age: 61.8(6.2) years, 52.8% were females) diagnosed with AMD were included in this study as divided into ranibizumab (n=34) and bevacizumab (n=38) treatment groups. Twenty-four hour, nighttime, and daytime ABMP values for systolic and diastolic BP were recorded in study groups before and after the third intravitreal injection of ranibizumab or bevacizumab.ResultsRanibizumab injection had no impact on ABPM recordings and dipping status. In the bevacizumab group, increased daytime (129.0(6.6) vs 127.7(6.6) mm Hg, P=0.002) and nighttime systolic (116.9(7.5) vs 112.6(7.1) mmHg, p<0.001) BP and decreased daytime diastolic (80.1(6.5) vs 82.4(6.1)mm Hg, P=0.001) BP were noted in the post-injection period. Also, percentage of non-dippers was significantly increased from 5.3% at pre-injection to 28.9% (P=0.004) at the post-injection period.ConclusionIn conclusion, given that it has no significant impact on ABPM recordings and dipping status, in our study, intravitreal ranibizumab injection may be the better choice in the management of AMD.
