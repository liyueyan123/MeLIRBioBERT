Subjective benefit of inhaled therapies in patients with bronchiectasis: a questionnaire study.The objectives of this study were to obtain information about the use and subjective benefits of inhaled therapies in patients with bronchiectasis and to determine if these benefits were related to the presence of airflow obstruction. One hundred and twenty patients completed a questionnaire on inhaled therapies and performed spirometry. Inhalers were used daily by 85/120 patients with bronchiectasis and 42/120 patients had a nebuliser. Inhaled therapies were used extensively in patients with (FEV1 < 80%) and without (FEV1 > 80%) evidence of airflow obstruction. The majority of patients reported subjective benefits from their inhaled therapies. Chi2 analysis showed that there was no association between perceived benefits of short acting bronchodilators (SAB), long acting bronchodilators (LAB), corticosteroids or nebulisers and degree of airflow obstruction. This study provides information about the subjective benefits of inhaled therapies which could facilitate a more comprehensive assessment of the net benefit of inhaled therapies in patients with bronchiectasis with and without airflow obstruction.
