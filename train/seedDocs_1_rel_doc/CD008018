Failure to preserve fertility in patients with Hodgkin's disease.The hypothesis that the "down-regulated" gonad is less vulnerable to the effects of cytotoxic chemotherapy for advanced Hodgkin's disease has been investigated. Thirty men and eighteen women were randomly allocated to receive an agonist analogue of gonadotrophin-releasing hormone prior to, and for the duration of, cytotoxic chemotherapy. Buserelin (d-Ser-[TBU]6 LHRH ethylamide) was prescribed in two different dosage schedules to twenty men, and in a single dosage schedule to eight women. A standard gonadotrophin-releasing hormone test (GnRH 100 micrograms) was performed 1 week prior to and on day 1 of each cycle of chemotherapy. In all patients peak luteinizing hormone responses to GnRH were suppressed throughout treatment. The higher of the two dosage schedules used in the men caused more effective suppression of luteinizing hormone, and both regimens led to an initial suppression of peak follicle-stimulating hormone responses to GnRH, which was not maintained. At follow-up assessment up to 3 years from the completion of treatment, all men treated with buserelin were profoundly oligospermic and four of the eight women were amenorrhoeic. All ten male controls were profoundly oligospermic, and six of nine female controls were amenorrhoeic. In the dosages and schedules investigated, buserelin was ineffective in conserving fertility.
