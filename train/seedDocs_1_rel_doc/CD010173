Oral cancer screening in a high-risk underserved community--Vancouver Downtown Eastside.The objective of this study was to evaluate a clinic-centered oral cancer screening initiative in one of the poorest communities in Canada, assessing the need for screening and the acceptance of screening and identifying hindrances to both screening and follow-up. The study group included 204 people in the Vancouver Downtown Eastside (DTES). This was shown to be a high-risk community based on risk factors, lack of access to care, and the high frequency of oral mucosal anomalies. Acceptance of screening was high (98%); however, acceptance of biopsy for abnormal findings and follow-up was low. Among the 12 patients with clinical leukoplakia who were biopsied, 10 showed cancer or precancer. In summary, these data show a need for screening in this population and an ability to recruit patients to screening. They support a future expansion of this initiative to create a more comprehensive strategy for outreach to this underserved community that extends to screening, diagnostic work-up, and treatment.
