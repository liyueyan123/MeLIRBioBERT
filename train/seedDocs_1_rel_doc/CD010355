Intermittent positive-pressure breathing after lung surgery.Intermittent positive-pressure breathing is thought to avoid atelectasis and improve pulmonary function after major lung resections. Since no clear scientific data was available to confirm this, our objective was to determine whether atelectasis can be avoided and if postoperative lung function is improved. Prospective analysis was carried out in 135 patients operated on between 2007 and 2009; 55 received intermittent positive-pressure breathing. Pre- and postoperative lung function tests were similar in both groups. Pulmonary complications were observed in 19% of patients without intermittent positive-pressure breathing and 27% of those who received this treatment. We were unable to find evidence that additional improvement in postoperative pulmonary function is achieved when adding intermittent positive-pressure breathing to the standard physical therapy.
