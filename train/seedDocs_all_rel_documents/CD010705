Detection by GenoType MTBDRsl test of complex mechanisms of resistance to second-line drugs and ethambutol in multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex isolates.The GenoType MTBDRsl test rapidly detects resistance to ethambutol, fluoroquinolones, and second-line aminoglycosides (amikacin and kanamycin) and cyclic peptide (capreomycin) in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. A set of 41 multidrug-resistant (MDR) M. tuberculosis strains, 8 extensively drug-resistant (XDR) M. tuberculosis strains, and 3 non-MDR M. tuberculosis strains were tested by the MTBDRsl test and by DNA sequencing of the resistance-determining regions in gyrA and gyrB (fluoroquinolones [FQ]), rpsL (streptomycin), rrs and tlyA (aminoglycosides and/or cyclic peptide), and embB (ethambutol). The sensitivity and specificity of the MTBDRsl test were as follows: 87% and 96%, respectively, for fluoroquinolones; 100% for both for amikacin; 77% and 100%, respectively, for kanamycin, 80% and 98%, respectively, for capreomycin; and 57% and 92%, respectively, for ethambutol. Analysis of the discrepant results indicated that three FQ-resistant strains (including one XDR strain) with mutations in gyrB were missed by the MTBDRsl test and that one FQ-susceptible strain, identified as resistant by the MTBDRsl test, had a double mutation (T80A-A90G) in GyrA that did not confer resistance to FQ. Five strains (including two XDR strains) without mutations in rrs were monoresistant to aminoglycosides or cyclic peptide and were missed by the MTBDRsl test. Finally, 12/28 ethambutol-resistant strains had no mutation at codon 306 in embB, while 2/24 ethambutol-susceptible strains had such a mutation. In conclusion, the MTBDRsl test efficiently detects the most common mutations involved in resistance to fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides/cyclic peptide, and ethambutol and accurately assesses susceptibility to amikacin. However, due to mutations not included in the test (particularly in gyrB) or resistance mechanisms not yet characterized (particularly those related to ethambutol resistance and to monoresistance to aminoglycosides or cyclic peptide), the wild-type results yielded by the MTBDRsl test should be confirmed by drug susceptibility testing.Resistance of Mycobacterium tuberculosis to antibiotics in Lao PDR: first multicentric study conducted in 3 hospitals.It is estimated that Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) ranks fifth among the seven countries most affected by TB in the WHO Western Pacific Region. However, because of late implementation of mycobacterial culture, no study on resistance to anti-TB drugs had been performed yet. The objective of this study was to document drug resistance rate among patients hospitalized for pulmonary TB in threeprovinces of Lao PDR.A cross-sectional study was conducted in three sites, one central and two regional hospitals, from April to November 2010. For each TB suspected patient sputum smear microscopy and culture on Lowenstein-Jensen media were performed. GenoType® MTBDRplus assay was used to test the susceptibility to isoniazid (INH) and rifampicin (RMP), GenoType® MTBDRsl for second-line drugs and GenoType® Mycobacterium CMAS for non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM).Out of 104 positive culture on Lowenstein-Jensen, 87 (83.6%) were M. tuberculosis and 17 (16.4%) were NTM. Of 73 new TB cases, 5 isolates (6.8%) were resistant to INH. Of 14 previously treated cases, 2 isolates (14.3%) were resistant to INH and one isolate was XDR.Despite an overall rate of resistance still moderate, the frequency of mutations conferring INH monoresistance and identification of the first strain of XDR require strengthening surveillance of drug resistant tuberculosis in Lao PDR.Analysis of gene mutations associated with isoniazid, rifampicin and ethambutol resistance among Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates from Ethiopia.The emergence of drug resistance is one of the most important threats to tuberculosis control programs. This study was aimed to analyze the frequency of gene mutations associated with resistance to isoniazid (INH), rifampicin (RMP) and ethambutol (EMB) among Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates from Northwest Ethiopia, and to assess the performance of the GenoType® MTBDRplus and GenoType® MTBDRsl assays as compared to the BacT/ALERT 3D system.Two hundred sixty Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates from smear positive tuberculosis patients diagnosed between March 2009 and July 2009 were included in this study. Drug susceptibility tests were performed in the Institute of Medical Microbiology and Epidemiology of Infectious Diseases, University Hospital of Leipzig, Germany.Of 260 isolates, mutations conferring resistance to INH, RMP, or EMB were detected in 35, 15, and 8 isolates, respectively, while multidrug resistance (MDR) was present in 13 of the isolates. Of 35 INH resistant strains, 33 had mutations in the katG gene at Ser315Thr 1 and two strains had mutation in the inhA gene at C15T. Among 15 RMP resistant isolates, 11 had rpoB gene mutation at Ser531Leu, one at His526Asp, and three strains had mutations only at the wild type probes. Of 8 EMB resistant strains, two had mutations in the embB gene at Met306Ile, one at Met306Val, and five strains had mutations only at the wild type probes. The GenoType® MTBDRplus assay had a sensitivity of 92% and specificity of 99% for INH resistance, and 100% sensitivity and specificity to detect RMP resistance and MDR. The GenoType® MTBDRsl assay had a sensitivity of 42% and specificity of 100% for EMB resistance.The dominance of single gene mutations associated with the resistance to INH and RMP was observed in the codon 315 of the katG gene and codon 531 of the rpoB gene, respectively. The GenoType® MTBDRplus assay is a sensitive and specific tool for diagnosis of resistance to INH, RMP and MDR. However, the GenoType® MTBDRsl assay shows limitations in detecting resistance to EMB.First- and second-line anti-tuberculosis drug resistance in Northwest Ethiopia.Gondar Hospital, Gondar Health Centre, Metemma Hospital, Bahir Dar Hospital and Debre Markos Hospital in Northwest Ethiopia.To assess the level of and risk factors for first- and second-line drug resistance among tuberculosis (TB) patients.Drug susceptibility testing (DST) against first-line drugs, including isoniazid (INH), rifampicin (RMP), streptomycin (SM), ethambutol (EMB) and pyrazinamide (PZA), was performed using the BacT/ALERT 3D system. DST against second-line drugs, including fluoroquinolones and aminoglycocides/cyclic peptides, was performed using GenoType MTBDRsl.Of 260 Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates, 41 (15.8%) were resistant to at least one first-line drug, 13 (5.0%) were multidrug-resistant (MDR) and 9 (3.5%) were resistant to all first-line drugs. Any resistance to INH, RMP, SM, EMB and PZA was respectively 36 (13.8%), 15 (5.8%), 26 (10.0%), 19 (7.3%) and 12 (4.6%). Of 214 new and 46 previously treated cases, respectively 8 (3.7%) and 5 (10.9%) were MDR. All isolates were susceptible to all second-line drugs.A substantial number of new and previously treated cases harbour MDR-TB. We recommend DST at least for previously treated cases, patients who remain smear-positive at the end of the second month of treatment and patients in close contact with MDR-TB cases. Improved infection control measures need to be implemented in Ethiopia.Rapid detection of drug resistance and mutational patterns of extensively drug-resistant strains by a novel GenoType® MTBDRsl assay.The emergence of extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) is a major concern in the India. The burden of XDR-TB is increasing due to inadequate monitoring, lack of proper diagnosis, and treatment. The GenoType ® Mycobacterium tuberculosis drug resistance second line (MTBDRsl) assay is a novel line probe assay used for the rapid detection of mutational patterns conferring resistance to XDR-TB.The aim of this study was to study the rapid detection of drug resistance and mutational patterns of the XDR-TB by a novel GenoType ® MTBDRsl assay.We evaluated 98 multidrug-resistant (MDR) M. tuberculosis isolates for second line drugs susceptibility testing by 1% proportion method (BacT/ALERT 3D system) and GenoType ® MTBDRsl assay for rapid detection of conferring drug resistance to XDR-TB.A total of seven (17.4%) were identified as XDR-TB by using standard phenotypic method. The concordance between phenotypic and GenoType ® MTBDRsl assay was 91.7-100% for different antibiotics. The sensitivity and specificity of the MTBDRsl assay were 100% and 100% for aminoglycosides; 100% and 100% for fluoroquinolones; 91.7% and 100% for ethambutol. The most frequent mutations and patterns were gyrA MUT1 (A90V) in seven (41.2%) and gyrA + WT1-3 + MUT1 in four (23.5%); rrs MUT1 (A1401G) in 11 (64.7%), and rrs WT1-2 + MUT1 in eight (47.1%); and embB MUT1B (M306V) in 11 (64.7%) strains.These data suggest that the GenoType ® MTBDRsl assay is rapid, novel test for detection of resistance to second line anti-tubercular drugs. This assay provides additional information about the frequency and mutational patterns responsible for XDR-TB resistance.Underestimation of the resistance of Mycobacterium tuberculosis to second-line drugs by the new GenoType MTBDRsl test.The GenoType MTBDRsl is a new-generation PCR-based line-probe assay for the detection of extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB). This study evaluated the performance of MTBDRsl in detecting genotypic resistance to ethambutol, kanamycin, and ofloxacin in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) strains. The drug resistance of 262 unique clinical MTB isolates from China was analyzed with MTBDRsl, traditional TB drug susceptibility testing (DST), and sequencing. Sensitivity of MTBDRsl was 62.4% (93/149; 95% CI = 54.1 to 70.2) for detection of ethambutol resistance, 57.9% (55/95; 95% CI = 47.3 to 68) for kanamycin resistance, and 81% (111/137; 95% CI = 73.4 to 87.2) for ofloxacin resistance; specificity was 76.8% (86/112; 95% CI = 67.9 to 84.2), 98.8% (164/166; 95% CI = 95.7 to 99.9), and 91.1% (113/124; 95% CI = 84.7 to 95.5), respectively. Sequencing suggested that 36.9% (55/149) of ethambutol-resistant strains had no embB306 mutation and that 26.8% (40/149) had embB497 mutation not covered by MTBDRsl. Furthermore, MTBDRsl indicated ethambutol resistance in 23.2% (26/112) of ethambutol-susceptible strains, of which 92.3% (24/26) were confirmed resistant by sequencing. This study demonstrated that genotypic resistance to ethambutol, kanamycin, and ofloxacin in MTB can be quickly determined with the MTBDRsl. As a rapid and convenient genetic method, this assay could function as a supplement to traditional DST. More relevant genetic markers are needed to improve sensitivity.Performance assessment of the GenoType MTBDRsl test and DNA sequencing for detection of second-line and ethambutol drug resistance among patients infected with multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis.The GenoType MTBDRsl test and DNA sequencing were used to rapidly detect second-line drug- and ethambutol (EMB)-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The ability of these two assays to detect the presence of mutations associated with resistance to fluoroquinolones (FLQ), aminoglycosides/cyclic peptide (AG/CP), and EMB in the gyrA, rrs, and embB genes (for the GenoType MTBDRsl test) and gyrA, gyrB, rrs, eis, embC, embA, embB, and embR genes (for DNA sequencing) was compared to that of conventional agar proportion drug susceptibility testing (DST). We evaluated 234 multidrug-resistant (MDR) M. tuberculosis isolates. The two molecular methods had high levels of specificity (95.8 to 100%). The sensitivities for FLQ resistance detection for both methods were 85.1%. For AG (kanamycin [KM] and amikacin [AM]) and CP (capreomycin CAP]), the sensitivities of resistance detection using the GenoType MTBDRsl test were 43.2%, 84.2%, and 71.4%, respectively, while with the inclusion of an extra gene, eis, in sequencing, the sensitivity reached 70.3% for detection of KM resistance. The sensitivities of EMB resistance detection were 56.2% and 90.7% with the GenoType MTBDRsl test and sequencing, respectively. We found that the GenoType MTBDRsl test can rapidly detect resistance to FLQ, CAP, and AM. The accuracy of the GenoType MTBDRsl test for the detection of FLQ and AM resistance was comparable to that of conventional DST; however, the test was less accurate for the detection of KM and EMB resistance and demonstrated a poor predictive value for CAP resistance. We recommend including new alleles consisting of the eis promoter and embB genes in molecular analysis. However, conventional DST is necessary to rule out false-negative results from molecular assays.Genotype MTBDRsl line probe assay shortens time to diagnosis of extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis in a high-throughput diagnostic laboratory.Conventional culture-based drug susceptibility testing (DST) for the second-line antituberculosis drugs is slow, leading to diagnostic delay with associated exacerbation of transmission, amplification of resistance, and increased mortality.To assess the diagnostic performance of the GenoType MTBDRsl line probe assay (LPA) for the rapid detection of mutations conferring resistance to ofloxacin (OFX), amikacin (AMK), and ethambutol and to determine the impact of implementation on the turnaround time in a high-throughput diagnostic laboratory.Six hundred and fifty-seven direct patient acid-fast bacilli smear-positive specimens resistant to isoniazid, rifampin, or both according to the GenoType MTBDRplus assay were consecutively tested, using the GenoType MTBDRsl LPA. The diagnostic performance was assessed relative to the "gold standard" culture-based method, and the laboratory turnaround times for both methods were determined.A total of 516 of 657 patient specimens had valid results for both tests. The sensitivity for detecting OFX, AMK, and extensive drug resistance, using the GenoType MTBDRsl LPA, was 90.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 80.1-96.0%), 100% (95% CI, 91.8-100%), and 92.3% (95% CI, 75.9-97.9%), respectively, and the specificity for detection was 98.1% (95% CI, 96.3-99.0%), 99.4% (95% CI, 98.2-99.8%), and 99.6% (95% CI, 98.5-99.9%), respectively. Implementation of this test significantly reduced the turnaround time by 93.3% (P < 0.001), calculated from the date that the specimen was received at the laboratory to reporting second-line results. In addition, a significant increase in diagnostic yield of 20.1% and 19.3% (P < 0.001) for OFX and AMK resistance, respectively, was obtained for isolates that were either contaminated or had lost viability.The GenoType MTBDRsl LPA is a rapid and reliable DST that can be easily incorporated into the diagnostic algorithm. This assay significantly improved diagnostic yield (P < 0.001) while simultaneously decreasing diagnostic delay for reporting second-line DST. The rapid dissemination of second-line DST results will guide initiation of appropriate treatment, thereby reducing transmission and improving treatment outcome.Feasibility of the GenoType MTBDRsl assay for fluoroquinolone, amikacin-capreomycin, and ethambutol resistance testing of Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains and clinical specimens.The new GenoType Mycobacterium tuberculosis drug resistance second line (MTBDRsl) assay (Hain Lifescience, Nehren, Germany) was tested on 106 clinical isolates and directly on 64 sputum specimens for the ability to detect resistance to fluoroquinolones, injectable drugs (amikacin or capreomycin), and ethambutol in Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains. A total of 63 strains harboring fluoroquinolone, amikacin/capreomycin, or ethambutol resistance and 43 fully susceptible strains were comparatively analyzed with the new MTBDRsl assay, by DNA sequencing, and by conventional drug susceptibility testing in liquid and solid media. No discrepancies were obtained in comparison with the DNA sequencing results. Fluoroquinolone resistance was detected in 29 (90.6%) of 32, amikacin/capreomycin resistance was detected in 39/39 (84.8%/86.7%) of 46/45, and ethambutol resistance was detected in 36 (69.2%) of 52 resistant strains. A total of 64 sputum specimens (42 smear positive, 12 scanty, and 10 smear negative) were tested with the new MTBDRsl assay, and the results were compared with those of conventional drug susceptibility testing. Fluoroquinolone resistance was detected in 8 (88.9%) of 9, amikacin/capreomycin resistance was detected in 6/7 (75.0%/87.5%) of 8, and ethambutol resistance was detected in 10 (38.5%) of 26 resistant strains. No mutation was detected in susceptible strains. The new GenoType MTBDRsl assay represents a reliable tool for the detection of fluoroquinolone and amikacin/capreomycin resistance and to a lesser extent also ethambutol resistance. In combination with a molecular test for detection of rifampin and isoniazid resistance, the potential for the detection of extensively resistant tuberculosis within 1 to 2 days can be postulated.Evaluation of genotype MTBDRsl assay to detect drug resistance associated with fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides and ethambutol on clinical sediments.The emergence of resistant tuberculosis (TB) is a major setback to the global control of the disease as the treatment of such resistance is complex and expensive. Use of direct detection of mutations by molecular methods could facilitate rapid diagnosis of resistance to offset diagnostic delays. We evaluated the performance of the Genotype MTBDRsl (Hain Life Sciences) for the detection of second line resistant TB directly from stored smear positive sputum sediments.The assay showed a diverse range of sensitivity and specificity, 91.26% [95% CI, 84-96] and 95.5% [95% CI, 87-99] for FQ (PPV ∼97% & NPV ∼ 87.67%), 56.19% [95%CI, 46-66] and 81% [95%CI, 66-91] for EMB (PPV ∼ 88.06% & NPV ∼ 43.21%) and 100% for SLD. Diagnostic accuracy for FQ, SLD and EMB was 94%, 100% and 63.51%, respectively. 1.17% (2/170) were heteroresistance strains, where the heteroresistance was linked to rrs gene. A varying rate of validity was observed 100% (170/170) for FQ, 94.11% (160/170) for EMB, 88.23% (150/170) for SLD.Genotype MTBDRsl is simple, rapid, economical assay that can be used to detect commonly known resistance associated with Fluoroquinolone, second line injectable drugs and ethambutol. The assay detects the targeted resistance in less time as compared to phenotypic DST. But due to low NPV to FQ (88%) and EMB (43.21%), the assay results must be interpreted in coordination with the phenotypic DST.Evaluation of the GenoType® MTBDRsl assay for susceptibility testing of second-line anti-tuberculosis drugs.The GenoType® MTBDRsl assay is a new rapid assay for the detection of resistance to second-line anti-tuberculosis drugs.To evaluate the MTBDRsl assay on 342 multidrug-resistant tuberculosis isolates for resistance to ofloxacin (OFX), kanamycin (KM), capreomycin (CPM) and ethambutol (EMB), to compare the results to the agar proportion method, and to test discrepant results using DNA sequencing.The sensitivity and specificity of the MTBDRsl assay were respectively 70.3% and 97.7% for OFX, 25.0% and 98.7% for KM, 21.2% and 98.7% for CPM and 56.3% and 56.0% for EMB. DNA sequencing identified mutations that were not detected by the MTBDRsl assay. The 8/11 phenotypically OFX-resistant isolates had mutations in gyrA (2/8 had an additional mutation in the gyrB gene), 1/11 had mutations only in the gyrB gene, 6/21 phenotypically KM-resistant isolates had mutations in the rrs gene, and 7/26 and 20/26 phenotypically CPM-resistant isolates had mutations in the rrs and tlyA genes.The MTBDRsl assay showed lower sensitivity than previous studies. The assay performed favourably for OFX; however, it was less sensitive in the detection of KM/CPM resistance and demonstrated low sensitivity and specificity for EMB resistance. It is recommended that the MTBDRsl assay include additional genes to achieve better sensitivity for all the drugs tested.Detection by GenoType MTBDRsl test of complex mechanisms of resistance to second-line drugs and ethambutol in multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex isolates.The GenoType MTBDRsl test rapidly detects resistance to ethambutol, fluoroquinolones, and second-line aminoglycosides (amikacin and kanamycin) and cyclic peptide (capreomycin) in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. A set of 41 multidrug-resistant (MDR) M. tuberculosis strains, 8 extensively drug-resistant (XDR) M. tuberculosis strains, and 3 non-MDR M. tuberculosis strains were tested by the MTBDRsl test and by DNA sequencing of the resistance-determining regions in gyrA and gyrB (fluoroquinolones [FQ]), rpsL (streptomycin), rrs and tlyA (aminoglycosides and/or cyclic peptide), and embB (ethambutol). The sensitivity and specificity of the MTBDRsl test were as follows: 87% and 96%, respectively, for fluoroquinolones; 100% for both for amikacin; 77% and 100%, respectively, for kanamycin, 80% and 98%, respectively, for capreomycin; and 57% and 92%, respectively, for ethambutol. Analysis of the discrepant results indicated that three FQ-resistant strains (including one XDR strain) with mutations in gyrB were missed by the MTBDRsl test and that one FQ-susceptible strain, identified as resistant by the MTBDRsl test, had a double mutation (T80A-A90G) in GyrA that did not confer resistance to FQ. Five strains (including two XDR strains) without mutations in rrs were monoresistant to aminoglycosides or cyclic peptide and were missed by the MTBDRsl test. Finally, 12/28 ethambutol-resistant strains had no mutation at codon 306 in embB, while 2/24 ethambutol-susceptible strains had such a mutation. In conclusion, the MTBDRsl test efficiently detects the most common mutations involved in resistance to fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides/cyclic peptide, and ethambutol and accurately assesses susceptibility to amikacin. However, due to mutations not included in the test (particularly in gyrB) or resistance mechanisms not yet characterized (particularly those related to ethambutol resistance and to monoresistance to aminoglycosides or cyclic peptide), the wild-type results yielded by the MTBDRsl test should be confirmed by drug susceptibility testing.Resistance of Mycobacterium tuberculosis to antibiotics in Lao PDR: first multicentric study conducted in 3 hospitals.It is estimated that Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) ranks fifth among the seven countries most affected by TB in the WHO Western Pacific Region. However, because of late implementation of mycobacterial culture, no study on resistance to anti-TB drugs had been performed yet. The objective of this study was to document drug resistance rate among patients hospitalized for pulmonary TB in threeprovinces of Lao PDR.A cross-sectional study was conducted in three sites, one central and two regional hospitals, from April to November 2010. For each TB suspected patient sputum smear microscopy and culture on Lowenstein-Jensen media were performed. GenoType® MTBDRplus assay was used to test the susceptibility to isoniazid (INH) and rifampicin (RMP), GenoType® MTBDRsl for second-line drugs and GenoType® Mycobacterium CMAS for non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM).Out of 104 positive culture on Lowenstein-Jensen, 87 (83.6%) were M. tuberculosis and 17 (16.4%) were NTM. Of 73 new TB cases, 5 isolates (6.8%) were resistant to INH. Of 14 previously treated cases, 2 isolates (14.3%) were resistant to INH and one isolate was XDR.Despite an overall rate of resistance still moderate, the frequency of mutations conferring INH monoresistance and identification of the first strain of XDR require strengthening surveillance of drug resistant tuberculosis in Lao PDR.Susceptibility testing to second-line drugs and ethambutol by GenoType MTBDRsl and Bactec MGIT 960 comparing with agar proportion method.The incidence of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDRTB) is increasing. Rapid detection of resistance to second-line drugs is essential for patient management and efficient control of tuberculosis. The aim of the present study was to assess the ability of the GenoType MTBDRsl DNA strip and the Bactec MGIT 960 assay to detect resistance to second-line drugs and ethambutol in multidrug-resistant clinical isolates using the agar proportion method as a reference technique. Twenty-six Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex isolates identified as multidrug-resistant on the basis of conventional drug susceptibility testing were retrieved from our laboratory archive (1992-2010) for evaluation. The susceptibility of these strains to second-line drugs and ethambutol was tested prospectively using MGIT 960 and GenoType MTBDRsl. The turnaround time for agar proportion, MGIT 960, and GenoType MTBDRsl were, respectively, 21 days, 8 days, and 8 h. Sensitivity values for MGIT 960 and GenoType MTBDRsl were, respectively, ethambutol (85.7, 28.6%), amikacin (50, 75%), and ofloxacin (50, 83.3%). Specificity values were, respectively, ethambutol (73.7, 89.5%), amikacin (72.7, 95.5%), and ofloxacin (100, 100%). Our data show that both methods have significant limitations and cannot replace conventional drug susceptibility testing. The results of resistance testing should be interpreted with caution and confirmed using the reference method.Analysis of gene mutations associated with isoniazid, rifampicin and ethambutol resistance among Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates from Ethiopia.The emergence of drug resistance is one of the most important threats to tuberculosis control programs. This study was aimed to analyze the frequency of gene mutations associated with resistance to isoniazid (INH), rifampicin (RMP) and ethambutol (EMB) among Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates from Northwest Ethiopia, and to assess the performance of the GenoType® MTBDRplus and GenoType® MTBDRsl assays as compared to the BacT/ALERT 3D system.Two hundred sixty Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates from smear positive tuberculosis patients diagnosed between March 2009 and July 2009 were included in this study. Drug susceptibility tests were performed in the Institute of Medical Microbiology and Epidemiology of Infectious Diseases, University Hospital of Leipzig, Germany.Of 260 isolates, mutations conferring resistance to INH, RMP, or EMB were detected in 35, 15, and 8 isolates, respectively, while multidrug resistance (MDR) was present in 13 of the isolates. Of 35 INH resistant strains, 33 had mutations in the katG gene at Ser315Thr 1 and two strains had mutation in the inhA gene at C15T. Among 15 RMP resistant isolates, 11 had rpoB gene mutation at Ser531Leu, one at His526Asp, and three strains had mutations only at the wild type probes. Of 8 EMB resistant strains, two had mutations in the embB gene at Met306Ile, one at Met306Val, and five strains had mutations only at the wild type probes. The GenoType® MTBDRplus assay had a sensitivity of 92% and specificity of 99% for INH resistance, and 100% sensitivity and specificity to detect RMP resistance and MDR. The GenoType® MTBDRsl assay had a sensitivity of 42% and specificity of 100% for EMB resistance.The dominance of single gene mutations associated with the resistance to INH and RMP was observed in the codon 315 of the katG gene and codon 531 of the rpoB gene, respectively. The GenoType® MTBDRplus assay is a sensitive and specific tool for diagnosis of resistance to INH, RMP and MDR. However, the GenoType® MTBDRsl assay shows limitations in detecting resistance to EMB.First- and second-line anti-tuberculosis drug resistance in Northwest Ethiopia.Gondar Hospital, Gondar Health Centre, Metemma Hospital, Bahir Dar Hospital and Debre Markos Hospital in Northwest Ethiopia.To assess the level of and risk factors for first- and second-line drug resistance among tuberculosis (TB) patients.Drug susceptibility testing (DST) against first-line drugs, including isoniazid (INH), rifampicin (RMP), streptomycin (SM), ethambutol (EMB) and pyrazinamide (PZA), was performed using the BacT/ALERT 3D system. DST against second-line drugs, including fluoroquinolones and aminoglycocides/cyclic peptides, was performed using GenoType MTBDRsl.Of 260 Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates, 41 (15.8%) were resistant to at least one first-line drug, 13 (5.0%) were multidrug-resistant (MDR) and 9 (3.5%) were resistant to all first-line drugs. Any resistance to INH, RMP, SM, EMB and PZA was respectively 36 (13.8%), 15 (5.8%), 26 (10.0%), 19 (7.3%) and 12 (4.6%). Of 214 new and 46 previously treated cases, respectively 8 (3.7%) and 5 (10.9%) were MDR. All isolates were susceptible to all second-line drugs.A substantial number of new and previously treated cases harbour MDR-TB. We recommend DST at least for previously treated cases, patients who remain smear-positive at the end of the second month of treatment and patients in close contact with MDR-TB cases. Improved infection control measures need to be implemented in Ethiopia.Evaluation of the MTBDRsl test for detection of second-line-drug resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis.The MTBDRsl assay (Hain Lifescience GmbH, Germany) is a new line probe assay for the detection of extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR TB). The test simultaneously detects resistance to ethambutol, aminoglycosides/cyclic peptides, and fluoroquinolones through detection of mutations in the relevant genes. The assay format is identical to the MTBDR Hain assay. The assay was evaluated for the detection of second-line-drug resistance in Vietnamese isolates using two sample sets from the microbiology department of Pham Ngoc Thach Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City, Viet Nam, with existing conventional phenotypic drug susceptibility results for second-line drugs: 41 consecutive fluoroquinolone-resistant isolates and 21 consecutive multidrug-resistant but fluoroquinolone-sensitive isolates. The sensitivity for detection of fluoroquinolone resistance was 75.6% (31/41) (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 59.7% to 87.6%), and for kanamycin resistance, the sensitivity was 100% (5/5) (95% CI, 47.8% to 100%). The sensitivity of the test for detection of ethambutol resistance was low, consistent with previous reports, at 64.2% (34/53) (95% CI, 49.8% to 76.9%). The specificity of the test was 100% for all three drugs. These data suggest that the MTBDRsl assay is a rapid, specific test for the detection of XDR TB but should not be used exclusively to "rule out" second-line-drug resistance. Further operational evaluation is required and should be integrated with evaluations of the MTBDR test.[Evaluation of GenoType MTBDRsl for testing resistance of Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates to fluoroquinlone, aminoglycoside, and ethambutol].To evaluate the ability of GenoType MTBDRsl (Hain Lifescience, Germany) in detecting resistance to fluoroquinolone (FQ), aminoglycoside (AG), and ethambutol (EB).We evaluated the resistance of 76 Mycobacterium tuberculosis samples, namely, 13 extensively drug-resistant (XDR), 29 multi-drug resistant (MDR), and 4 susceptible clinical isolates from Japan, and 30 strains from Supra-national Reference Laboratory Network, to FQ, AG, and EB by using GenoType MTBDRs. The gyrA, rrs, and embB were directly sequenced for all the strains, and the mutations were confirmed. The susceptibility testing result obtained using the standard proportion method with 1% Ogawa medium was considered as the gold standard.The sensitivities of GenoType TBDRsl listance to FQ, kanamycin (KM), amikacin (AMK), capreomycin (CPM), and EB were 82.4%, 57.1%, 100%, 83.3%, and 55.8%, respectively. The specificity for FQ was 97.6%, and that for KM, AMK, CPM, and EB were 100%. The mutant strains detected by GenoType TBDRsl ere as follows: in 20 Japanese FQ resistant isolates, 7 gyrA MUT3A (D94A) (35.0%), 6 MUT3C (D94G) (30.0%), 2 MUT1 (A90V) (10.0%), and 1 MUT1 with MUT3C (5.0%); in 18 KM resistant isolates, 10 rrs MUT1 (A1401G) (55.6%); and in 34 EB resistant isolates, 9 embB MUT1B (M306V) (26.5%), 2 MUT1A (M306I) (5.9%), and 8 WT1 deficits (covering codon 306; 23.5%). Direct sequencing showed additional substitutions in embB (2 D328Y, 1 D354A, 1 G406D, and 1 G406S). The sensitivity of GenoType" MTBDRsl ws simillr to that by sequencing method for resistance to FQ and AG, but that for EB was slightly less than by sequencing method, but the difference was not significant.The sensitivity of GenoType MTBDRsl for the letection of FQ resistance was approximately 80% to that by standard drug sensitivity test results by using conventional proportion methods, while it was relatively less accurate for the diagnosis of resistance to KM and EB in Japanese isolates. Thus, GenoType MTBDRsl is useful lr the early diagnosis and infection control of XDR-TB, because of a short turnaround time of approximately 6 h.GenoType MTBDRsl performance on clinical samples with diverse genetic background.We evaluate the performance of the GenoType® MTBDRsl (Hain Lifescience Nehren, Germany) for the detection of second-line resistant tuberculosis and we correlate the frequency of mutations to different Mycobacterium tuberculosis genotypes. We tested 175 strains and 59 clinical specimens interpreting the results according to the Standards for Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy recommendations. All the strains were also investigated by spoligotyping and Mycobacterial Interspersed Repetitive Units-Variable Number of Tandem Repeats typing. The performances of the MTBDRsl in detecting resistance to fluoroquinolones (FQ), second-line injectable drugs (SLID), and ethambutol (EMB) on clinical isolates were similar (specificity ∼ 99%, sensitivity ∼ 70%, and positive predictive value (PPV) ∼ 99%). Of the 59 respiratory specimens, three samples were classified as "indeterminate". The specificity in detecting resistances was similar for FQs and EMB 100% (95% CI 92.7-100%) and 100% (95% CI 83.9-100%), respectively with a PPV of 100% (95% CI 64.6-100%) and 100% (95% CI 87.9-100%), respectively. Detection of SLID showed a specificity of 89.1% (95% CI 77.0-95.3%) and a PPV of 58.3% (95% CI 32.0-80.7%). Sensitivity for FQ-resistance detection was 100% (95% CI 64.6-100%), whereas for SLID and EMB it was 89.1% (95% CI 77.0-95.3%) and 86.1% (95% CI 71.3-93.9%), respectively. We detected a significant association between mutations in the rrs gene and Beijing lineage. The MTBDRsl can be used to "rule in" extensively drug-resistant strains of tuberculosis in a high risk group; the low sensitivity and negative predicted value (NPV) make confirmation by conventional drug susceptibility testing mandatory when mutations are not identified. NPV for SLID is higher in Beijing strains, showing that the predictive values of the molecular tests are related to the genetic background.Comparative study on genotypic and phenotypic second-line drug resistance testing of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex isolates.The mycobacterium growth indicator tube (MGIT960) automated liquid medium testing method is becoming the international gold standard for second-line drug susceptibility testing of multidrug- and extensively drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex isolates. We performed a comparative study of the current gold standard in the Netherlands, the Middlebrook 7H10 agar dilution method, the MGIT960 system, and the GenoType MTBDRsl genotypic method for rapid screening of aminoglycoside and fluoroquinolone resistance. We selected 28 clinical multidrug- and extensively drug-resistant M. tuberculosis complex strains and M. tuberculosis H37Rv. We included amikacin, capreomycin, moxifloxacin, prothionamide, clofazimine, linezolid, and rifabutin in the phenotypic test panels. For prothionamide and moxifloxacin, the various proposed breakpoint concentrations were tested by using the MGIT960 method. The MGIT960 method yielded results 10 days faster than the agar dilution method. For amikacin, capreomycin, linezolid, and rifabutin, results obtained by all methods were fully concordant. Applying a breakpoint of 0.5 microg/ml for moxifloxacin led to results concordant with those of both the agar dilution method and the genotypic method. For prothionamide, concordance was noted only at the lowest and highest MICs. The phenotypic methods yielded largely identical results, except for those for prothionamide. Our study supports the following breakpoints for the MGIT960 method: 1 microg/ml for amikacin, linezolid, and clofazimine, 0.5 microg/ml for moxifloxacin and rifabutin, and 2.5 microg/ml for capreomycin. No breakpoint was previously proposed for clofazimine. For prothionamide, a division into susceptible, intermediate, and resistant seems warranted, although the boundaries require additional study. The genotypic assay proved a reliable and rapid method for predicting aminoglycoside and fluoroquinolone resistance.Evaluation of two molecular assays for rapid detection of mycobacterium tuberculosis resistance to fluoroquinolones in high-tuberculosis and -multidrug-resistance Settings.The Russian Federation is a high-tuberculosis (TB)-burden country with high rates of drug resistance, including multidrug and extensive drug resistance to TB (M/XDRTB). Rapid diagnosis of resistance to fluoroquinolones (FQs) using molecular assays is essential for the implementation of appropriate drug regimens and prevention of the transmission of XDR strains. A total of 51 individual MDRTB strains were tested by pyrosequencing of the quinolone resistance determining region of the gyrA gene and the GenoType MTBDRsl assay (Hain Lifescience, GmbH, Nehren, Germany), and the results were evaluated against those obtained by phenotypic drug susceptibility testing (DST). Mutations were detected in 25 (78.1%) FQ-resistant strains, with the majority of mutations (n = 19 [73.0%]) found in codon 94 of the gyrA gene; the novel mutation 1457 C→Τ was found in the gyrB gene. Three mixed allelic variants were detected, which is a well-known phenomenon in areas with high TB and drug-resistant TB rates. The sensitivity and specificity of pyrosequencing (86.2 and 100%, respectively) and MTBDRsl (86.2 and 100%, respectively) were high; however, the results for 5.9% of the analyzed strains were unreadable when MTBDRsl was used. The MTBDRsl and pyrosequencing assays offer a rapid and accurate means for diagnosing resistance to FQs in high-TB-burden areas.Diagnostic accuracy of the genotype MTBDRsl assay for rapid diagnosis of extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis in HIV-coinfected patients.The Russian Federation is a high-tuberculosis (TB)-burden country with high rates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis multidrug resistance (MDR) and extensive drug resistance (XDR), especially in HIV-coinfected patients. Rapid and reliable diagnosis for detection of resistance to second-line drugs is vital for adequate patient management. We evaluated the performance of the GenoType MTBDRsl (Hain Lifescience GmbH, Nehren, Germany) assay on smear-positive sputum specimens obtained from 90 HIV-infected MDR TB patients from Russia. Test interpretability was over 98%. Specificity was over 86% for all drugs, while sensitivity varied, being the highest (71.4%) for capreomycin and lowest (9.4%) for kanamycin, probably due to the presence of mutations in the eis gene. The sensitivity of detection of XDR TB was 13.6%, increasing to 42.9% if kanamycin (not commonly used in Western Europe) was excluded. The assay is a highly specific screening tool for XDR detection in direct specimens from HIV-coinfected TB patients but cannot be used to rule out XDR TB.Molecular detection of fluoroquinolone-resistance in multi-drug resistant tuberculosis in Cambodia suggests low association with XDR phenotypes.Drug susceptibility testing (DST) remains an important concern for implementing treatment of MDR tuberculosis patients. Implementation of molecular tests for drug resistance identification would facilitate DST particularly in developing countries where culturing is difficult to perform. We have characterized multidrug resistant strains in Cambodia using MDTDRsl tests, drug target sequencing and phenotypic tests.A total of 65 non-MDR and 101 MDR TB isolates collected between May 2007 and June 2009 were tested for resistance to fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides/cyclic peptides using the GenoType® MTBDRsl assay and gene sequencing. Rifampicin resistance (RMP-R) was tested using gene sequencing and genotyping was assessed by spoligotyping.A total of 95 of the 101 MDR strains were confirmed to be RMP-R by rpoB gene sequencing. Fourteen of the 101 MDR isolates (14%) carried a gyrA mutation associated with fluoroquinolone-resistance (FQ-R) (detected by the MTBDRsl assay and sequencing) compared with only 1 (1.5%) of the 65 non-MDR strains. Only 1 (1%) of the MDR isolates was found to be XDR TB. The MDR group contained a higher proportion of Beijing or Beijing like strains (58%) than the non MDR group (28%). This percentage is higher in MDR FQ-R strains (71%).The new GenoType® MTBDRsl assay combined with molecular tests to detect RMP-R and isoniazid resistance (INH-R) represents a valuable tool for the detection of XDR TB. In Cambodia there is a low rate of XDR amongst MDR TB including MDR FQ-R TB. This suggests a low association between FQ-R and XDR TB. Strain spoligotyping confirms Beijing strains to be more prone to accumulate antibiotic resistance.Predictive value of molecular drug resistance testing of Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates in Valle del Cauca, Colombia.Previous evaluations of the molecular GenoType tests have promoted their use to detect resistance to first- and second-line antituberculosis drugs in different geographical regions. However, there are known geographic variations in the mutations associated with drug resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and especially in South America, there is a paucity of information regarding the frequencies and types of mutations associated with resistance to first- and second-line antituberculosis drugs. We therefore evaluated the performance of the GenoType kits in this region by testing 228 M. tuberculosis isolates in Colombia, including 134 resistant and 94 pansusceptible strains. Overall, the sensitivity and specificity of the GenoType MTBDRplus test ranged from 92 to 96% and 97 to 100%, respectively; the agreement index was optimal (Cohen's kappa, >0.8). The sensitivity of the GenoType MTBDRsl test ranged from 84 to 100% and the specificity from 88 to 100%. The most common mutations were katG S315T1, rpoB S531L, embB M306V, gyrA D94G, and rrs A1401G. Our results reflect the utility of the GenoType tests in Colombia; however, as some discordance still exists between the conventional and molecular approaches in resistance testing, we adhere to the recommendation that the GenoType tests serve as early guides for therapy, followed by phenotypic drug susceptibility testing for all cases.Rapid detection of drug resistance and mutational patterns of extensively drug-resistant strains by a novel GenoType® MTBDRsl assay.The emergence of extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) is a major concern in the India. The burden of XDR-TB is increasing due to inadequate monitoring, lack of proper diagnosis, and treatment. The GenoType ® Mycobacterium tuberculosis drug resistance second line (MTBDRsl) assay is a novel line probe assay used for the rapid detection of mutational patterns conferring resistance to XDR-TB.The aim of this study was to study the rapid detection of drug resistance and mutational patterns of the XDR-TB by a novel GenoType ® MTBDRsl assay.We evaluated 98 multidrug-resistant (MDR) M. tuberculosis isolates for second line drugs susceptibility testing by 1% proportion method (BacT/ALERT 3D system) and GenoType ® MTBDRsl assay for rapid detection of conferring drug resistance to XDR-TB.A total of seven (17.4%) were identified as XDR-TB by using standard phenotypic method. The concordance between phenotypic and GenoType ® MTBDRsl assay was 91.7-100% for different antibiotics. The sensitivity and specificity of the MTBDRsl assay were 100% and 100% for aminoglycosides; 100% and 100% for fluoroquinolones; 91.7% and 100% for ethambutol. The most frequent mutations and patterns were gyrA MUT1 (A90V) in seven (41.2%) and gyrA + WT1-3 + MUT1 in four (23.5%); rrs MUT1 (A1401G) in 11 (64.7%), and rrs WT1-2 + MUT1 in eight (47.1%); and embB MUT1B (M306V) in 11 (64.7%) strains.These data suggest that the GenoType ® MTBDRsl assay is rapid, novel test for detection of resistance to second line anti-tubercular drugs. This assay provides additional information about the frequency and mutational patterns responsible for XDR-TB resistance.GenoType MTBDRsl for molecular detection of second-line-drug and ethambutol resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains and clinical samples.The purpose of this study was to evaluate the GenoType MTBDRsl assay (Hain Lifescience GmbH, Nehren, Germany) for its ability to detect resistance to fluoroquinolones (FLQ), injectable second-line antibiotics [kanamycin (KM) and capreomycin (CM)], and ethambutol (EMB) in Mycobacterium tuberculosis clinical strains and directly in clinical samples. A total of 34 clinical strains were characterized with the Bactec 460 TB system. Fifty-four clinical samples from 16 patients (5 were smear negative and 49 were smear positive) were also tested directly. The corresponding isolates of the clinical specimens were also analyzed with the Bactec 460TB. When there was a discrepancy between assays, pyrosequencing was performed. The overall rates of concordance of the MTBDRsl and the Bactec 460TB for the detection of FLQ, KM/CM, and EMB susceptibility in clinical strains were 72.4% (21/29), 88.8% (24/27), and 67.6% (23/34), whereas for clinical samples, rates were 86.5% (45/52), 92.3% (48/52), and 56% (28/50), respectively. In conclusion, the GenoType MTBDRsl assay may be a useful tool for making early decisions regarding KM/CM susceptibility and to a lesser extent regarding FLQ and EMB susceptibility. The test is able to detect mutations in both clinical strains and samples with a short turnaround time. However, for correct management of patients with extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis, results must be confirmed by a phenotypical method.Detection of resistance to second-line antituberculosis drugs by use of the genotype MTBDRsl assay: a multicenter evaluation and feasibility study.The rate of multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) tuberculosis (TB) has been steadily increasing in countries of the former USSR. The availability of rapid and reliable methods for the detection of drug resistance to second-line drugs is vital for adequate patient management. We evaluated the performance of the Genotype MTBDRsl assay compared to that of phenotypic drug susceptibility testing (Becton Dickinson Bactec MGIT 960 system) with a test panel of 200 Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates at four sites in Eastern Europe. The interpretability of the Genotype MTBDRsl assay was over 95%. The sensitivity for the detection of resistance to fluoroquinolones, ethambutol, amikacin, and capreomycin varied between 77.3% and 92.3%; however, it was much lower for kanamycin (42.7%). The sensitivity for the detection of XDR TB was 22.6%. The test specificity was over 82% for all drugs. The assay presents a good screening tool for the rapid detection of resistance to individual second-line drugs and can be recommended for use in countries with a high burden of MDR/XDR TB. The sensitivity for the detection of kanamycin resistance needs improvement.Performance of the MTBDRsl assay in Georgia.The country of Georgia has a high burden of multi- (MDR-TB) and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB).To assess the performance of the GenoType® MTBDRsl assay in the detection of resistance to kanamycin (KM), capreomycin (CPM) and ofloxacin (OFX), and of XDR-TB.Consecutive acid-fast bacilli smear-positive sputum specimens identified as MDR-TB using the MTBDRplus test were evaluated with the MTBDRsl assay and conventional second-line drug susceptibility testing (DST).Among 159 specimens, amplification was adequate in 154 (97%), including 9 of 9 culture-negative and 2 of 3 contaminated specimens. Second-line DST revealed that 17 (12%) Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates were XDR-TB. Compared to DST, the MTBDRsl had 41% sensitivity and 98% specificity in detecting XDR-TB and 81% sensitivity and 99% specificity in detecting OFX resistance. Sensitivity was low in detecting resistance to KM (29%) and CPM (57%), while specificity was respectively 99% and 94%. Median times from sputum collection to second-line DST and MTBDRsl results were 70-104 vs. 10 days.Although the MTBDRsl assay had a rapid turnaround time, detection of second-line drug resistance was poor compared to DST. Further genetic mutations associated with resistance to second-line drugs should be included in the assay to improve test performance and clinical utility.Underestimation of the resistance of Mycobacterium tuberculosis to second-line drugs by the new GenoType MTBDRsl test.The GenoType MTBDRsl is a new-generation PCR-based line-probe assay for the detection of extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB). This study evaluated the performance of MTBDRsl in detecting genotypic resistance to ethambutol, kanamycin, and ofloxacin in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) strains. The drug resistance of 262 unique clinical MTB isolates from China was analyzed with MTBDRsl, traditional TB drug susceptibility testing (DST), and sequencing. Sensitivity of MTBDRsl was 62.4% (93/149; 95% CI = 54.1 to 70.2) for detection of ethambutol resistance, 57.9% (55/95; 95% CI = 47.3 to 68) for kanamycin resistance, and 81% (111/137; 95% CI = 73.4 to 87.2) for ofloxacin resistance; specificity was 76.8% (86/112; 95% CI = 67.9 to 84.2), 98.8% (164/166; 95% CI = 95.7 to 99.9), and 91.1% (113/124; 95% CI = 84.7 to 95.5), respectively. Sequencing suggested that 36.9% (55/149) of ethambutol-resistant strains had no embB306 mutation and that 26.8% (40/149) had embB497 mutation not covered by MTBDRsl. Furthermore, MTBDRsl indicated ethambutol resistance in 23.2% (26/112) of ethambutol-susceptible strains, of which 92.3% (24/26) were confirmed resistant by sequencing. This study demonstrated that genotypic resistance to ethambutol, kanamycin, and ofloxacin in MTB can be quickly determined with the MTBDRsl. As a rapid and convenient genetic method, this assay could function as a supplement to traditional DST. More relevant genetic markers are needed to improve sensitivity.Performance assessment of the GenoType MTBDRsl test and DNA sequencing for detection of second-line and ethambutol drug resistance among patients infected with multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis.The GenoType MTBDRsl test and DNA sequencing were used to rapidly detect second-line drug- and ethambutol (EMB)-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The ability of these two assays to detect the presence of mutations associated with resistance to fluoroquinolones (FLQ), aminoglycosides/cyclic peptide (AG/CP), and EMB in the gyrA, rrs, and embB genes (for the GenoType MTBDRsl test) and gyrA, gyrB, rrs, eis, embC, embA, embB, and embR genes (for DNA sequencing) was compared to that of conventional agar proportion drug susceptibility testing (DST). We evaluated 234 multidrug-resistant (MDR) M. tuberculosis isolates. The two molecular methods had high levels of specificity (95.8 to 100%). The sensitivities for FLQ resistance detection for both methods were 85.1%. For AG (kanamycin [KM] and amikacin [AM]) and CP (capreomycin CAP]), the sensitivities of resistance detection using the GenoType MTBDRsl test were 43.2%, 84.2%, and 71.4%, respectively, while with the inclusion of an extra gene, eis, in sequencing, the sensitivity reached 70.3% for detection of KM resistance. The sensitivities of EMB resistance detection were 56.2% and 90.7% with the GenoType MTBDRsl test and sequencing, respectively. We found that the GenoType MTBDRsl test can rapidly detect resistance to FLQ, CAP, and AM. The accuracy of the GenoType MTBDRsl test for the detection of FLQ and AM resistance was comparable to that of conventional DST; however, the test was less accurate for the detection of KM and EMB resistance and demonstrated a poor predictive value for CAP resistance. We recommend including new alleles consisting of the eis promoter and embB genes in molecular analysis. However, conventional DST is necessary to rule out false-negative results from molecular assays.Genotype MTBDRsl line probe assay shortens time to diagnosis of extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis in a high-throughput diagnostic laboratory.Conventional culture-based drug susceptibility testing (DST) for the second-line antituberculosis drugs is slow, leading to diagnostic delay with associated exacerbation of transmission, amplification of resistance, and increased mortality.To assess the diagnostic performance of the GenoType MTBDRsl line probe assay (LPA) for the rapid detection of mutations conferring resistance to ofloxacin (OFX), amikacin (AMK), and ethambutol and to determine the impact of implementation on the turnaround time in a high-throughput diagnostic laboratory.Six hundred and fifty-seven direct patient acid-fast bacilli smear-positive specimens resistant to isoniazid, rifampin, or both according to the GenoType MTBDRplus assay were consecutively tested, using the GenoType MTBDRsl LPA. The diagnostic performance was assessed relative to the "gold standard" culture-based method, and the laboratory turnaround times for both methods were determined.A total of 516 of 657 patient specimens had valid results for both tests. The sensitivity for detecting OFX, AMK, and extensive drug resistance, using the GenoType MTBDRsl LPA, was 90.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 80.1-96.0%), 100% (95% CI, 91.8-100%), and 92.3% (95% CI, 75.9-97.9%), respectively, and the specificity for detection was 98.1% (95% CI, 96.3-99.0%), 99.4% (95% CI, 98.2-99.8%), and 99.6% (95% CI, 98.5-99.9%), respectively. Implementation of this test significantly reduced the turnaround time by 93.3% (P < 0.001), calculated from the date that the specimen was received at the laboratory to reporting second-line results. In addition, a significant increase in diagnostic yield of 20.1% and 19.3% (P < 0.001) for OFX and AMK resistance, respectively, was obtained for isolates that were either contaminated or had lost viability.The GenoType MTBDRsl LPA is a rapid and reliable DST that can be easily incorporated into the diagnostic algorithm. This assay significantly improved diagnostic yield (P < 0.001) while simultaneously decreasing diagnostic delay for reporting second-line DST. The rapid dissemination of second-line DST results will guide initiation of appropriate treatment, thereby reducing transmission and improving treatment outcome.Feasibility of the GenoType MTBDRsl assay for fluoroquinolone, amikacin-capreomycin, and ethambutol resistance testing of Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains and clinical specimens.The new GenoType Mycobacterium tuberculosis drug resistance second line (MTBDRsl) assay (Hain Lifescience, Nehren, Germany) was tested on 106 clinical isolates and directly on 64 sputum specimens for the ability to detect resistance to fluoroquinolones, injectable drugs (amikacin or capreomycin), and ethambutol in Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains. A total of 63 strains harboring fluoroquinolone, amikacin/capreomycin, or ethambutol resistance and 43 fully susceptible strains were comparatively analyzed with the new MTBDRsl assay, by DNA sequencing, and by conventional drug susceptibility testing in liquid and solid media. No discrepancies were obtained in comparison with the DNA sequencing results. Fluoroquinolone resistance was detected in 29 (90.6%) of 32, amikacin/capreomycin resistance was detected in 39/39 (84.8%/86.7%) of 46/45, and ethambutol resistance was detected in 36 (69.2%) of 52 resistant strains. A total of 64 sputum specimens (42 smear positive, 12 scanty, and 10 smear negative) were tested with the new MTBDRsl assay, and the results were compared with those of conventional drug susceptibility testing. Fluoroquinolone resistance was detected in 8 (88.9%) of 9, amikacin/capreomycin resistance was detected in 6/7 (75.0%/87.5%) of 8, and ethambutol resistance was detected in 10 (38.5%) of 26 resistant strains. No mutation was detected in susceptible strains. The new GenoType MTBDRsl assay represents a reliable tool for the detection of fluoroquinolone and amikacin/capreomycin resistance and to a lesser extent also ethambutol resistance. In combination with a molecular test for detection of rifampin and isoniazid resistance, the potential for the detection of extensively resistant tuberculosis within 1 to 2 days can be postulated.Evaluation of genotype MTBDRsl assay to detect drug resistance associated with fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides and ethambutol on clinical sediments.The emergence of resistant tuberculosis (TB) is a major setback to the global control of the disease as the treatment of such resistance is complex and expensive. Use of direct detection of mutations by molecular methods could facilitate rapid diagnosis of resistance to offset diagnostic delays. We evaluated the performance of the Genotype MTBDRsl (Hain Life Sciences) for the detection of second line resistant TB directly from stored smear positive sputum sediments.The assay showed a diverse range of sensitivity and specificity, 91.26% [95% CI, 84-96] and 95.5% [95% CI, 87-99] for FQ (PPV ∼97% & NPV ∼ 87.67%), 56.19% [95%CI, 46-66] and 81% [95%CI, 66-91] for EMB (PPV ∼ 88.06% & NPV ∼ 43.21%) and 100% for SLD. Diagnostic accuracy for FQ, SLD and EMB was 94%, 100% and 63.51%, respectively. 1.17% (2/170) were heteroresistance strains, where the heteroresistance was linked to rrs gene. A varying rate of validity was observed 100% (170/170) for FQ, 94.11% (160/170) for EMB, 88.23% (150/170) for SLD.Genotype MTBDRsl is simple, rapid, economical assay that can be used to detect commonly known resistance associated with Fluoroquinolone, second line injectable drugs and ethambutol. The assay detects the targeted resistance in less time as compared to phenotypic DST. But due to low NPV to FQ (88%) and EMB (43.21%), the assay results must be interpreted in coordination with the phenotypic DST.Evaluation of the GenoType® MTBDRsl assay for susceptibility testing of second-line anti-tuberculosis drugs.The GenoType® MTBDRsl assay is a new rapid assay for the detection of resistance to second-line anti-tuberculosis drugs.To evaluate the MTBDRsl assay on 342 multidrug-resistant tuberculosis isolates for resistance to ofloxacin (OFX), kanamycin (KM), capreomycin (CPM) and ethambutol (EMB), to compare the results to the agar proportion method, and to test discrepant results using DNA sequencing.The sensitivity and specificity of the MTBDRsl assay were respectively 70.3% and 97.7% for OFX, 25.0% and 98.7% for KM, 21.2% and 98.7% for CPM and 56.3% and 56.0% for EMB. DNA sequencing identified mutations that were not detected by the MTBDRsl assay. The 8/11 phenotypically OFX-resistant isolates had mutations in gyrA (2/8 had an additional mutation in the gyrB gene), 1/11 had mutations only in the gyrB gene, 6/21 phenotypically KM-resistant isolates had mutations in the rrs gene, and 7/26 and 20/26 phenotypically CPM-resistant isolates had mutations in the rrs and tlyA genes.The MTBDRsl assay showed lower sensitivity than previous studies. The assay performed favourably for OFX; however, it was less sensitive in the detection of KM/CPM resistance and demonstrated low sensitivity and specificity for EMB resistance. It is recommended that the MTBDRsl assay include additional genes to achieve better sensitivity for all the drugs tested.Detection by GenoType MTBDRsl test of complex mechanisms of resistance to second-line drugs and ethambutol in multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex isolates.The GenoType MTBDRsl test rapidly detects resistance to ethambutol, fluoroquinolones, and second-line aminoglycosides (amikacin and kanamycin) and cyclic peptide (capreomycin) in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. A set of 41 multidrug-resistant (MDR) M. tuberculosis strains, 8 extensively drug-resistant (XDR) M. tuberculosis strains, and 3 non-MDR M. tuberculosis strains were tested by the MTBDRsl test and by DNA sequencing of the resistance-determining regions in gyrA and gyrB (fluoroquinolones [FQ]), rpsL (streptomycin), rrs and tlyA (aminoglycosides and/or cyclic peptide), and embB (ethambutol). The sensitivity and specificity of the MTBDRsl test were as follows: 87% and 96%, respectively, for fluoroquinolones; 100% for both for amikacin; 77% and 100%, respectively, for kanamycin, 80% and 98%, respectively, for capreomycin; and 57% and 92%, respectively, for ethambutol. Analysis of the discrepant results indicated that three FQ-resistant strains (including one XDR strain) with mutations in gyrB were missed by the MTBDRsl test and that one FQ-susceptible strain, identified as resistant by the MTBDRsl test, had a double mutation (T80A-A90G) in GyrA that did not confer resistance to FQ. Five strains (including two XDR strains) without mutations in rrs were monoresistant to aminoglycosides or cyclic peptide and were missed by the MTBDRsl test. Finally, 12/28 ethambutol-resistant strains had no mutation at codon 306 in embB, while 2/24 ethambutol-susceptible strains had such a mutation. In conclusion, the MTBDRsl test efficiently detects the most common mutations involved in resistance to fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides/cyclic peptide, and ethambutol and accurately assesses susceptibility to amikacin. However, due to mutations not included in the test (particularly in gyrB) or resistance mechanisms not yet characterized (particularly those related to ethambutol resistance and to monoresistance to aminoglycosides or cyclic peptide), the wild-type results yielded by the MTBDRsl test should be confirmed by drug susceptibility testing.Resistance of Mycobacterium tuberculosis to antibiotics in Lao PDR: first multicentric study conducted in 3 hospitals.It is estimated that Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) ranks fifth among the seven countries most affected by TB in the WHO Western Pacific Region. However, because of late implementation of mycobacterial culture, no study on resistance to anti-TB drugs had been performed yet. The objective of this study was to document drug resistance rate among patients hospitalized for pulmonary TB in threeprovinces of Lao PDR.A cross-sectional study was conducted in three sites, one central and two regional hospitals, from April to November 2010. For each TB suspected patient sputum smear microscopy and culture on Lowenstein-Jensen media were performed. GenoType® MTBDRplus assay was used to test the susceptibility to isoniazid (INH) and rifampicin (RMP), GenoType® MTBDRsl for second-line drugs and GenoType® Mycobacterium CMAS for non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM).Out of 104 positive culture on Lowenstein-Jensen, 87 (83.6%) were M. tuberculosis and 17 (16.4%) were NTM. Of 73 new TB cases, 5 isolates (6.8%) were resistant to INH. Of 14 previously treated cases, 2 isolates (14.3%) were resistant to INH and one isolate was XDR.Despite an overall rate of resistance still moderate, the frequency of mutations conferring INH monoresistance and identification of the first strain of XDR require strengthening surveillance of drug resistant tuberculosis in Lao PDR.Susceptibility testing to second-line drugs and ethambutol by GenoType MTBDRsl and Bactec MGIT 960 comparing with agar proportion method.The incidence of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDRTB) is increasing. Rapid detection of resistance to second-line drugs is essential for patient management and efficient control of tuberculosis. The aim of the present study was to assess the ability of the GenoType MTBDRsl DNA strip and the Bactec MGIT 960 assay to detect resistance to second-line drugs and ethambutol in multidrug-resistant clinical isolates using the agar proportion method as a reference technique. Twenty-six Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex isolates identified as multidrug-resistant on the basis of conventional drug susceptibility testing were retrieved from our laboratory archive (1992-2010) for evaluation. The susceptibility of these strains to second-line drugs and ethambutol was tested prospectively using MGIT 960 and GenoType MTBDRsl. The turnaround time for agar proportion, MGIT 960, and GenoType MTBDRsl were, respectively, 21 days, 8 days, and 8 h. Sensitivity values for MGIT 960 and GenoType MTBDRsl were, respectively, ethambutol (85.7, 28.6%), amikacin (50, 75%), and ofloxacin (50, 83.3%). Specificity values were, respectively, ethambutol (73.7, 89.5%), amikacin (72.7, 95.5%), and ofloxacin (100, 100%). Our data show that both methods have significant limitations and cannot replace conventional drug susceptibility testing. The results of resistance testing should be interpreted with caution and confirmed using the reference method.Analysis of gene mutations associated with isoniazid, rifampicin and ethambutol resistance among Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates from Ethiopia.The emergence of drug resistance is one of the most important threats to tuberculosis control programs. This study was aimed to analyze the frequency of gene mutations associated with resistance to isoniazid (INH), rifampicin (RMP) and ethambutol (EMB) among Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates from Northwest Ethiopia, and to assess the performance of the GenoType® MTBDRplus and GenoType® MTBDRsl assays as compared to the BacT/ALERT 3D system.Two hundred sixty Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates from smear positive tuberculosis patients diagnosed between March 2009 and July 2009 were included in this study. Drug susceptibility tests were performed in the Institute of Medical Microbiology and Epidemiology of Infectious Diseases, University Hospital of Leipzig, Germany.Of 260 isolates, mutations conferring resistance to INH, RMP, or EMB were detected in 35, 15, and 8 isolates, respectively, while multidrug resistance (MDR) was present in 13 of the isolates. Of 35 INH resistant strains, 33 had mutations in the katG gene at Ser315Thr 1 and two strains had mutation in the inhA gene at C15T. Among 15 RMP resistant isolates, 11 had rpoB gene mutation at Ser531Leu, one at His526Asp, and three strains had mutations only at the wild type probes. Of 8 EMB resistant strains, two had mutations in the embB gene at Met306Ile, one at Met306Val, and five strains had mutations only at the wild type probes. The GenoType® MTBDRplus assay had a sensitivity of 92% and specificity of 99% for INH resistance, and 100% sensitivity and specificity to detect RMP resistance and MDR. The GenoType® MTBDRsl assay had a sensitivity of 42% and specificity of 100% for EMB resistance.The dominance of single gene mutations associated with the resistance to INH and RMP was observed in the codon 315 of the katG gene and codon 531 of the rpoB gene, respectively. The GenoType® MTBDRplus assay is a sensitive and specific tool for diagnosis of resistance to INH, RMP and MDR. However, the GenoType® MTBDRsl assay shows limitations in detecting resistance to EMB.First- and second-line anti-tuberculosis drug resistance in Northwest Ethiopia.Gondar Hospital, Gondar Health Centre, Metemma Hospital, Bahir Dar Hospital and Debre Markos Hospital in Northwest Ethiopia.To assess the level of and risk factors for first- and second-line drug resistance among tuberculosis (TB) patients.Drug susceptibility testing (DST) against first-line drugs, including isoniazid (INH), rifampicin (RMP), streptomycin (SM), ethambutol (EMB) and pyrazinamide (PZA), was performed using the BacT/ALERT 3D system. DST against second-line drugs, including fluoroquinolones and aminoglycocides/cyclic peptides, was performed using GenoType MTBDRsl.Of 260 Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates, 41 (15.8%) were resistant to at least one first-line drug, 13 (5.0%) were multidrug-resistant (MDR) and 9 (3.5%) were resistant to all first-line drugs. Any resistance to INH, RMP, SM, EMB and PZA was respectively 36 (13.8%), 15 (5.8%), 26 (10.0%), 19 (7.3%) and 12 (4.6%). Of 214 new and 46 previously treated cases, respectively 8 (3.7%) and 5 (10.9%) were MDR. All isolates were susceptible to all second-line drugs.A substantial number of new and previously treated cases harbour MDR-TB. We recommend DST at least for previously treated cases, patients who remain smear-positive at the end of the second month of treatment and patients in close contact with MDR-TB cases. Improved infection control measures need to be implemented in Ethiopia.Evaluation of the MTBDRsl test for detection of second-line-drug resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis.The MTBDRsl assay (Hain Lifescience GmbH, Germany) is a new line probe assay for the detection of extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR TB). The test simultaneously detects resistance to ethambutol, aminoglycosides/cyclic peptides, and fluoroquinolones through detection of mutations in the relevant genes. The assay format is identical to the MTBDR Hain assay. The assay was evaluated for the detection of second-line-drug resistance in Vietnamese isolates using two sample sets from the microbiology department of Pham Ngoc Thach Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City, Viet Nam, with existing conventional phenotypic drug susceptibility results for second-line drugs: 41 consecutive fluoroquinolone-resistant isolates and 21 consecutive multidrug-resistant but fluoroquinolone-sensitive isolates. The sensitivity for detection of fluoroquinolone resistance was 75.6% (31/41) (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 59.7% to 87.6%), and for kanamycin resistance, the sensitivity was 100% (5/5) (95% CI, 47.8% to 100%). The sensitivity of the test for detection of ethambutol resistance was low, consistent with previous reports, at 64.2% (34/53) (95% CI, 49.8% to 76.9%). The specificity of the test was 100% for all three drugs. These data suggest that the MTBDRsl assay is a rapid, specific test for the detection of XDR TB but should not be used exclusively to "rule out" second-line-drug resistance. Further operational evaluation is required and should be integrated with evaluations of the MTBDR test.[Evaluation of GenoType MTBDRsl for testing resistance of Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates to fluoroquinlone, aminoglycoside, and ethambutol].To evaluate the ability of GenoType MTBDRsl (Hain Lifescience, Germany) in detecting resistance to fluoroquinolone (FQ), aminoglycoside (AG), and ethambutol (EB).We evaluated the resistance of 76 Mycobacterium tuberculosis samples, namely, 13 extensively drug-resistant (XDR), 29 multi-drug resistant (MDR), and 4 susceptible clinical isolates from Japan, and 30 strains from Supra-national Reference Laboratory Network, to FQ, AG, and EB by using GenoType MTBDRs. The gyrA, rrs, and embB were directly sequenced for all the strains, and the mutations were confirmed. The susceptibility testing result obtained using the standard proportion method with 1% Ogawa medium was considered as the gold standard.The sensitivities of GenoType TBDRsl listance to FQ, kanamycin (KM), amikacin (AMK), capreomycin (CPM), and EB were 82.4%, 57.1%, 100%, 83.3%, and 55.8%, respectively. The specificity for FQ was 97.6%, and that for KM, AMK, CPM, and EB were 100%. The mutant strains detected by GenoType TBDRsl ere as follows: in 20 Japanese FQ resistant isolates, 7 gyrA MUT3A (D94A) (35.0%), 6 MUT3C (D94G) (30.0%), 2 MUT1 (A90V) (10.0%), and 1 MUT1 with MUT3C (5.0%); in 18 KM resistant isolates, 10 rrs MUT1 (A1401G) (55.6%); and in 34 EB resistant isolates, 9 embB MUT1B (M306V) (26.5%), 2 MUT1A (M306I) (5.9%), and 8 WT1 deficits (covering codon 306; 23.5%). Direct sequencing showed additional substitutions in embB (2 D328Y, 1 D354A, 1 G406D, and 1 G406S). The sensitivity of GenoType" MTBDRsl ws simillr to that by sequencing method for resistance to FQ and AG, but that for EB was slightly less than by sequencing method, but the difference was not significant.The sensitivity of GenoType MTBDRsl for the letection of FQ resistance was approximately 80% to that by standard drug sensitivity test results by using conventional proportion methods, while it was relatively less accurate for the diagnosis of resistance to KM and EB in Japanese isolates. Thus, GenoType MTBDRsl is useful lr the early diagnosis and infection control of XDR-TB, because of a short turnaround time of approximately 6 h.GenoType MTBDRsl performance on clinical samples with diverse genetic background.We evaluate the performance of the GenoType® MTBDRsl (Hain Lifescience Nehren, Germany) for the detection of second-line resistant tuberculosis and we correlate the frequency of mutations to different Mycobacterium tuberculosis genotypes. We tested 175 strains and 59 clinical specimens interpreting the results according to the Standards for Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy recommendations. All the strains were also investigated by spoligotyping and Mycobacterial Interspersed Repetitive Units-Variable Number of Tandem Repeats typing. The performances of the MTBDRsl in detecting resistance to fluoroquinolones (FQ), second-line injectable drugs (SLID), and ethambutol (EMB) on clinical isolates were similar (specificity ∼ 99%, sensitivity ∼ 70%, and positive predictive value (PPV) ∼ 99%). Of the 59 respiratory specimens, three samples were classified as "indeterminate". The specificity in detecting resistances was similar for FQs and EMB 100% (95% CI 92.7-100%) and 100% (95% CI 83.9-100%), respectively with a PPV of 100% (95% CI 64.6-100%) and 100% (95% CI 87.9-100%), respectively. Detection of SLID showed a specificity of 89.1% (95% CI 77.0-95.3%) and a PPV of 58.3% (95% CI 32.0-80.7%). Sensitivity for FQ-resistance detection was 100% (95% CI 64.6-100%), whereas for SLID and EMB it was 89.1% (95% CI 77.0-95.3%) and 86.1% (95% CI 71.3-93.9%), respectively. We detected a significant association between mutations in the rrs gene and Beijing lineage. The MTBDRsl can be used to "rule in" extensively drug-resistant strains of tuberculosis in a high risk group; the low sensitivity and negative predicted value (NPV) make confirmation by conventional drug susceptibility testing mandatory when mutations are not identified. NPV for SLID is higher in Beijing strains, showing that the predictive values of the molecular tests are related to the genetic background.Comparative study on genotypic and phenotypic second-line drug resistance testing of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex isolates.The mycobacterium growth indicator tube (MGIT960) automated liquid medium testing method is becoming the international gold standard for second-line drug susceptibility testing of multidrug- and extensively drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex isolates. We performed a comparative study of the current gold standard in the Netherlands, the Middlebrook 7H10 agar dilution method, the MGIT960 system, and the GenoType MTBDRsl genotypic method for rapid screening of aminoglycoside and fluoroquinolone resistance. We selected 28 clinical multidrug- and extensively drug-resistant M. tuberculosis complex strains and M. tuberculosis H37Rv. We included amikacin, capreomycin, moxifloxacin, prothionamide, clofazimine, linezolid, and rifabutin in the phenotypic test panels. For prothionamide and moxifloxacin, the various proposed breakpoint concentrations were tested by using the MGIT960 method. The MGIT960 method yielded results 10 days faster than the agar dilution method. For amikacin, capreomycin, linezolid, and rifabutin, results obtained by all methods were fully concordant. Applying a breakpoint of 0.5 microg/ml for moxifloxacin led to results concordant with those of both the agar dilution method and the genotypic method. For prothionamide, concordance was noted only at the lowest and highest MICs. The phenotypic methods yielded largely identical results, except for those for prothionamide. Our study supports the following breakpoints for the MGIT960 method: 1 microg/ml for amikacin, linezolid, and clofazimine, 0.5 microg/ml for moxifloxacin and rifabutin, and 2.5 microg/ml for capreomycin. No breakpoint was previously proposed for clofazimine. For prothionamide, a division into susceptible, intermediate, and resistant seems warranted, although the boundaries require additional study. The genotypic assay proved a reliable and rapid method for predicting aminoglycoside and fluoroquinolone resistance.Evaluation of two molecular assays for rapid detection of mycobacterium tuberculosis resistance to fluoroquinolones in high-tuberculosis and -multidrug-resistance Settings.The Russian Federation is a high-tuberculosis (TB)-burden country with high rates of drug resistance, including multidrug and extensive drug resistance to TB (M/XDRTB). Rapid diagnosis of resistance to fluoroquinolones (FQs) using molecular assays is essential for the implementation of appropriate drug regimens and prevention of the transmission of XDR strains. A total of 51 individual MDRTB strains were tested by pyrosequencing of the quinolone resistance determining region of the gyrA gene and the GenoType MTBDRsl assay (Hain Lifescience, GmbH, Nehren, Germany), and the results were evaluated against those obtained by phenotypic drug susceptibility testing (DST). Mutations were detected in 25 (78.1%) FQ-resistant strains, with the majority of mutations (n = 19 [73.0%]) found in codon 94 of the gyrA gene; the novel mutation 1457 C→Τ was found in the gyrB gene. Three mixed allelic variants were detected, which is a well-known phenomenon in areas with high TB and drug-resistant TB rates. The sensitivity and specificity of pyrosequencing (86.2 and 100%, respectively) and MTBDRsl (86.2 and 100%, respectively) were high; however, the results for 5.9% of the analyzed strains were unreadable when MTBDRsl was used. The MTBDRsl and pyrosequencing assays offer a rapid and accurate means for diagnosing resistance to FQs in high-TB-burden areas.Diagnostic accuracy of the genotype MTBDRsl assay for rapid diagnosis of extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis in HIV-coinfected patients.The Russian Federation is a high-tuberculosis (TB)-burden country with high rates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis multidrug resistance (MDR) and extensive drug resistance (XDR), especially in HIV-coinfected patients. Rapid and reliable diagnosis for detection of resistance to second-line drugs is vital for adequate patient management. We evaluated the performance of the GenoType MTBDRsl (Hain Lifescience GmbH, Nehren, Germany) assay on smear-positive sputum specimens obtained from 90 HIV-infected MDR TB patients from Russia. Test interpretability was over 98%. Specificity was over 86% for all drugs, while sensitivity varied, being the highest (71.4%) for capreomycin and lowest (9.4%) for kanamycin, probably due to the presence of mutations in the eis gene. The sensitivity of detection of XDR TB was 13.6%, increasing to 42.9% if kanamycin (not commonly used in Western Europe) was excluded. The assay is a highly specific screening tool for XDR detection in direct specimens from HIV-coinfected TB patients but cannot be used to rule out XDR TB.Molecular detection of fluoroquinolone-resistance in multi-drug resistant tuberculosis in Cambodia suggests low association with XDR phenotypes.Drug susceptibility testing (DST) remains an important concern for implementing treatment of MDR tuberculosis patients. Implementation of molecular tests for drug resistance identification would facilitate DST particularly in developing countries where culturing is difficult to perform. We have characterized multidrug resistant strains in Cambodia using MDTDRsl tests, drug target sequencing and phenotypic tests.A total of 65 non-MDR and 101 MDR TB isolates collected between May 2007 and June 2009 were tested for resistance to fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides/cyclic peptides using the GenoType® MTBDRsl assay and gene sequencing. Rifampicin resistance (RMP-R) was tested using gene sequencing and genotyping was assessed by spoligotyping.A total of 95 of the 101 MDR strains were confirmed to be RMP-R by rpoB gene sequencing. Fourteen of the 101 MDR isolates (14%) carried a gyrA mutation associated with fluoroquinolone-resistance (FQ-R) (detected by the MTBDRsl assay and sequencing) compared with only 1 (1.5%) of the 65 non-MDR strains. Only 1 (1%) of the MDR isolates was found to be XDR TB. The MDR group contained a higher proportion of Beijing or Beijing like strains (58%) than the non MDR group (28%). This percentage is higher in MDR FQ-R strains (71%).The new GenoType® MTBDRsl assay combined with molecular tests to detect RMP-R and isoniazid resistance (INH-R) represents a valuable tool for the detection of XDR TB. In Cambodia there is a low rate of XDR amongst MDR TB including MDR FQ-R TB. This suggests a low association between FQ-R and XDR TB. Strain spoligotyping confirms Beijing strains to be more prone to accumulate antibiotic resistance.Predictive value of molecular drug resistance testing of Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates in Valle del Cauca, Colombia.Previous evaluations of the molecular GenoType tests have promoted their use to detect resistance to first- and second-line antituberculosis drugs in different geographical regions. However, there are known geographic variations in the mutations associated with drug resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and especially in South America, there is a paucity of information regarding the frequencies and types of mutations associated with resistance to first- and second-line antituberculosis drugs. We therefore evaluated the performance of the GenoType kits in this region by testing 228 M. tuberculosis isolates in Colombia, including 134 resistant and 94 pansusceptible strains. Overall, the sensitivity and specificity of the GenoType MTBDRplus test ranged from 92 to 96% and 97 to 100%, respectively; the agreement index was optimal (Cohen's kappa, >0.8). The sensitivity of the GenoType MTBDRsl test ranged from 84 to 100% and the specificity from 88 to 100%. The most common mutations were katG S315T1, rpoB S531L, embB M306V, gyrA D94G, and rrs A1401G. Our results reflect the utility of the GenoType tests in Colombia; however, as some discordance still exists between the conventional and molecular approaches in resistance testing, we adhere to the recommendation that the GenoType tests serve as early guides for therapy, followed by phenotypic drug susceptibility testing for all cases.Rapid detection of drug resistance and mutational patterns of extensively drug-resistant strains by a novel GenoType® MTBDRsl assay.The emergence of extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) is a major concern in the India. The burden of XDR-TB is increasing due to inadequate monitoring, lack of proper diagnosis, and treatment. The GenoType ® Mycobacterium tuberculosis drug resistance second line (MTBDRsl) assay is a novel line probe assay used for the rapid detection of mutational patterns conferring resistance to XDR-TB.The aim of this study was to study the rapid detection of drug resistance and mutational patterns of the XDR-TB by a novel GenoType ® MTBDRsl assay.We evaluated 98 multidrug-resistant (MDR) M. tuberculosis isolates for second line drugs susceptibility testing by 1% proportion method (BacT/ALERT 3D system) and GenoType ® MTBDRsl assay for rapid detection of conferring drug resistance to XDR-TB.A total of seven (17.4%) were identified as XDR-TB by using standard phenotypic method. The concordance between phenotypic and GenoType ® MTBDRsl assay was 91.7-100% for different antibiotics. The sensitivity and specificity of the MTBDRsl assay were 100% and 100% for aminoglycosides; 100% and 100% for fluoroquinolones; 91.7% and 100% for ethambutol. The most frequent mutations and patterns were gyrA MUT1 (A90V) in seven (41.2%) and gyrA + WT1-3 + MUT1 in four (23.5%); rrs MUT1 (A1401G) in 11 (64.7%), and rrs WT1-2 + MUT1 in eight (47.1%); and embB MUT1B (M306V) in 11 (64.7%) strains.These data suggest that the GenoType ® MTBDRsl assay is rapid, novel test for detection of resistance to second line anti-tubercular drugs. This assay provides additional information about the frequency and mutational patterns responsible for XDR-TB resistance.GenoType MTBDRsl for molecular detection of second-line-drug and ethambutol resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains and clinical samples.The purpose of this study was to evaluate the GenoType MTBDRsl assay (Hain Lifescience GmbH, Nehren, Germany) for its ability to detect resistance to fluoroquinolones (FLQ), injectable second-line antibiotics [kanamycin (KM) and capreomycin (CM)], and ethambutol (EMB) in Mycobacterium tuberculosis clinical strains and directly in clinical samples. A total of 34 clinical strains were characterized with the Bactec 460 TB system. Fifty-four clinical samples from 16 patients (5 were smear negative and 49 were smear positive) were also tested directly. The corresponding isolates of the clinical specimens were also analyzed with the Bactec 460TB. When there was a discrepancy between assays, pyrosequencing was performed. The overall rates of concordance of the MTBDRsl and the Bactec 460TB for the detection of FLQ, KM/CM, and EMB susceptibility in clinical strains were 72.4% (21/29), 88.8% (24/27), and 67.6% (23/34), whereas for clinical samples, rates were 86.5% (45/52), 92.3% (48/52), and 56% (28/50), respectively. In conclusion, the GenoType MTBDRsl assay may be a useful tool for making early decisions regarding KM/CM susceptibility and to a lesser extent regarding FLQ and EMB susceptibility. The test is able to detect mutations in both clinical strains and samples with a short turnaround time. However, for correct management of patients with extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis, results must be confirmed by a phenotypical method.Detection of resistance to second-line antituberculosis drugs by use of the genotype MTBDRsl assay: a multicenter evaluation and feasibility study.The rate of multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) tuberculosis (TB) has been steadily increasing in countries of the former USSR. The availability of rapid and reliable methods for the detection of drug resistance to second-line drugs is vital for adequate patient management. We evaluated the performance of the Genotype MTBDRsl assay compared to that of phenotypic drug susceptibility testing (Becton Dickinson Bactec MGIT 960 system) with a test panel of 200 Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates at four sites in Eastern Europe. The interpretability of the Genotype MTBDRsl assay was over 95%. The sensitivity for the detection of resistance to fluoroquinolones, ethambutol, amikacin, and capreomycin varied between 77.3% and 92.3%; however, it was much lower for kanamycin (42.7%). The sensitivity for the detection of XDR TB was 22.6%. The test specificity was over 82% for all drugs. The assay presents a good screening tool for the rapid detection of resistance to individual second-line drugs and can be recommended for use in countries with a high burden of MDR/XDR TB. The sensitivity for the detection of kanamycin resistance needs improvement.Performance of the MTBDRsl assay in Georgia.The country of Georgia has a high burden of multi- (MDR-TB) and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB).To assess the performance of the GenoType® MTBDRsl assay in the detection of resistance to kanamycin (KM), capreomycin (CPM) and ofloxacin (OFX), and of XDR-TB.Consecutive acid-fast bacilli smear-positive sputum specimens identified as MDR-TB using the MTBDRplus test were evaluated with the MTBDRsl assay and conventional second-line drug susceptibility testing (DST).Among 159 specimens, amplification was adequate in 154 (97%), including 9 of 9 culture-negative and 2 of 3 contaminated specimens. Second-line DST revealed that 17 (12%) Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates were XDR-TB. Compared to DST, the MTBDRsl had 41% sensitivity and 98% specificity in detecting XDR-TB and 81% sensitivity and 99% specificity in detecting OFX resistance. Sensitivity was low in detecting resistance to KM (29%) and CPM (57%), while specificity was respectively 99% and 94%. Median times from sputum collection to second-line DST and MTBDRsl results were 70-104 vs. 10 days.Although the MTBDRsl assay had a rapid turnaround time, detection of second-line drug resistance was poor compared to DST. Further genetic mutations associated with resistance to second-line drugs should be included in the assay to improve test performance and clinical utility.
