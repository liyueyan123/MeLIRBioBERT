Long-term antihypertensive efficacy and safety of the oral direct renin inhibitor aliskiren: a 12-month randomized, double-blind comparator trial with hydrochlorothiazide.Diuretics are recommended as first-line agents for the treatment of hypertension. This randomized, double-blind, multicenter study assessed the long-term efficacy and safety of the direct renin inhibitor aliskiren in comparison with the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide in patients with essential hypertension.After a 2- to 4-week placebo run-in, 1124 patients (mean sitting diastolic blood pressure [BP] 95 to 109 mm Hg) were randomized to aliskiren 150 mg (n=459), hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg (n=444), or placebo (n=221) once daily. Forced titration (to aliskiren 300 mg or hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg) occurred at week 3; at week 6, patients receiving placebo were reassigned (1:1 ratio) to aliskiren 300 mg or hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg. From week 12, amlodipine 5 mg was added and titrated to 10 mg from week 18 for patients whose BP remained uncontrolled. Efficacy variables were analyzed for the intent-to-treat population with the use of the last observation carried forward method. BP reductions (mean sitting systolic BP/mean sitting diastolic BP) were significantly greater with aliskiren- versus hydrochlorothiazide-based treatment at week 26 (-20.3/-14.2 versus -18.6/-13.0 mm Hg; P<0.05) and were also greater at week 52 (-22.1/-16.0 versus -21.2/-15.0 mm Hg; P<0.05 for mean sitting diastolic BP). At the end of the monotherapy period (week 12), aliskiren 300 mg was superior to hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg in reducing BP (-17.4/-12.2 versus -14.7/-10.3 mm H; P<0.001). Adverse event rates were similar with aliskiren- (65.2%) and hydrochlorothiazide-based therapy (61.5%). Hypokalemia was more frequent with hydrochlorothiazide-based therapy than aliskiren-based therapy (17.9% versus 0.9%; P<0.0001).Aliskiren treatment, both as monotherapy and with optional addition of amlodipine, provided significantly greater BP reductions than the respective hydrochlorothiazide regimens. Aliskiren-based therapy was well tolerated. Direct renin inhibition with aliskiren therefore represents an effective option for the long-term treatment of essential hypertension.Antihypertensive therapy in type 2 diabetes: implications of the appropriate blood pressure control in diabetes (ABCD) trial.As the population ages, the incidence of type 2 diabetes will increase as will the incidence of concomitant vascular complications. Hypertension substantially increases the risk of cardiovascular disease in patients with diabetes. Results from the recent Appropriate Blood Pressure Control in Diabetes (ABCD) trial demonstrated an advantage of an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (enalapril) over a long-acting calcium antagonist (nisoldipine) with regard to the incidence of cardiovascular events over a 5-year follow-up period in hypertensive persons with type 2 diabetes. This trial was a prospective, randomized, blinded study comparing the effects of moderate blood pressure control (target diastolic pressure 80-89 mm Hg) with those of intensive control (target diastolic pressure 75 mm Hg) on the incidence and progression of diabetic vascular complications. The study also compared nisoldipine with enalapril as first-line antihypertensive therapy in terms of prevention and progression of complications of diabetes. In 470 hypertensive patients, the incidence of fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarctions was significantly (p = 0.001) higher among those receiving nisoldipine (n = 25) compared with those receiving enalapril (n = 5). Comparison with previous studies suggests that the difference observed between nisoldipine and enalapril resulted from a beneficial effect of enalapril rather than a deleterious effect from nisoldipine. Since these findings in the ABCD trial are based on a secondary endpoint, they require confirmation. Nevertheless, they suggest that ACE inhibitors should be the initial antihypertensive medication used in patients with type 2 diabetes and hypertension.Pharmacogenetic association of NOS3 variants with cardiovascular disease in patients with hypertension: the GenHAT study.Nitric oxide synthase 3 (NOS3) catalyzes production of NO in the endothelium and may play a role in cardiovascular disease (CVD). We assessed the pharmacogenetic associations of three NOS3 polymorphisms and three antihypertensive drugs with CVD outcomes. Hypertensive subjects (n = 30,280) from a multi-center, double-blind clinical trial were randomized to chlorthalidone, amlodipine, or lisinopril treatment (mean follow up, 4.9 years). Outcomes included coronary heart disease (CHD: fatal CHD and nonfatal myocardial infarction); stroke; heart failure (fatal, requiring hospitalization, or outpatient treatment); all-cause mortality; and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Main effects of NOS3 variants on outcome and genotype-treatment interactions were tested. For NOS3 -690 C>T (rs3918226), a higher hazard ratio (HR) was found in minor allele carriers for CHD (CC = 1.00, CT+TT = 1.12 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.00-1.26), P = 0.048). For NOS3 -922 A>G (rs1800779), a higher HR was found in minor allele carriers for heart failure (AA = 1.00, AG+GG = 1.10 (CI = 1.00-1.21), P = 0.046). Significant pharmacogenetic findings were observed for stroke and all-cause mortality. For -690 C>T, a lower HR was observed for stroke in minor allele carriers when treated with amlodipine versus lisinopril (CC = 0.85 (CI = 0.73-0.99), CT+TT = 0.49 (CI = 0.31-0.80), P = 0.04). For glu298asp G>T (rs1799983), a lower HR was observed for all-cause mortality in minor allele carriers when treated with amlodipine versus lisinopril (GG = 1.01 (CI = 0.91-1.13), GT+TT = 0.85 (CI = 0.75-0.97), P = 0.04). We observed significant associations with NOS3 variants and CHD and heart failure and significant pharmacogenetic effects for stroke and all cause mortality. This suggests that NOS3 variants may potentially provide useful clinical information with respect to treatment decisions in the future.Heart failure in ALLHAT: did blood pressure medication at study entry influence outcome?J Clin Hypertens (Greenwich). 2009;11:466-474. (c)2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.Lower heart failure (HF) rates in individuals taking chlorthalidone vs amlodipine, lisinopril, or doxazosin were unanticipated in the Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT). HF differences appeared early, leading to questions about the possible influence of pre-enrollment antihypertensive drugs. A post hoc study evaluated hospitalized HF events. During year 1479 individuals had HF, with pre-entry antihypertensive medication data obtained on 301 patients (63%). Case-only analysis examined interactive effects (interaction odds ratio [OR, ratio of ORs]) of previous medication and ALLHAT treatment on HF outcomes, eg, did treatment effect differ by pre-entry antihypertensive class? Among cases, 39%, 37%, 17%, and 47% were taking pre-entry diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, beta-blockers, and calcium channel blockers, respectively. Interaction OR for year 1 HF for amlodipine vs chlorthalidone for patients taking vs not taking diuretics pre-entry was 1.08 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.53-2.21; P=.83); for lisinopril vs chlorthalidone, 1.33 (95% CI, 0.65-2.74; P=.44); and for doxazosin vs chlorthalidone, 1.13 (95% CI, 0.57-2.25; P=.73). Controlling for other pre-entry antihypertensives yielded similar results. There was no significant evidence that pre-entry drug type explained observed hospitalized HF differences by ALLHAT treatment.Effects of losartan or atenolol in hypertensive patients without clinically evident vascular disease: a substudy of the LIFE randomized trial.Cardiovascular morbidity and mortality are reduced by treatment with the angiotensin II AT(1)-receptor antagonist losartan compared with conventional treatment with the beta-blocker atenolol in patients with hypertension and electrocardiogram-defined left ventricular hypertrophy, many of whom had known vascular disease.To determine whether losartan reduces cardiovascular event rates in lower-risk hypertensive patients without clinically evident vascular disease.Subgroup analysis of a randomized trial.The Losartan Intervention for Endpoint reduction in hypertension (LIFE) study.6886 men and women (57% women) 55 to 80 years of age (average, 66 years) with essential hypertension (sitting blood pressure, 160 to 200/95 to 115 mm Hg [average, 174/98 mm Hg]) and electrocardiogram-defined left ventricular hypertrophy who did not have clinically evident vascular disease.Patients were randomly assigned to once-daily double-blind treatment with losartan or atenolol.An end point committee ascertained end points (cardiovascular death, stroke, or myocardial infarction).Blood pressure was reduced similarly by losartan and atenolol. The primary composite end point occurred in 282 losartan-treated patients (17.5 per 1000 patient-years) and 355 atenolol-treated patients (21.8 per 1000 patient-years; relative risk, 0.81 [95% CI, 0.69 to 0.95]; P = 0.008). Cardiovascular death occurred in 103 losartan-treated patients and 132 atenolol-treated patients (relative risk, 0.80 [CI, 0.62 to 1.04]; P = 0.092), stroke (nonfatal and fatal) occurred in 125 losartan-treated patients and 193 atenolol-treated patients (relative risk, 0.66 [CI, 0.53 to 0.82]; P < 0.001), and myocardial infarction (nonfatal and fatal) occurred in 110 losartan-treated patients and 100 atenolol-treated patients (relative risk, 1.14 [CI, 0.87 to 1.49]; P > 0.2). New-onset diabetes occurred less often in patients treated with losartan (n = 173) than in patients treated with atenolol (n = 254) (relative risk, 0.69 [CI, 0.57 to 0.84]; P < 0.001). Benefits of losartan treatment were numerically smaller, but not significantly so, in patients with preexisting vascular disease.In hypertensive patients without clinically evident vascular disease, losartan was more effective than atenolol in preventing cardiovascular morbidity and death, predominantly stroke, independent of blood pressure reduction.Comparison of effects of quinapril and metoprolol on glycaemic control, serum lipids, blood pressure, albuminuria and quality of life in non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus patients with hypertension. Swedish Quinapril Group.To compare the long-term effects of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitor quinapril and the cardioselective beta-adrenergic blocking agent metoprolol on glycaemic control, with glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) as the principal variable, in non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) patients with hypertension.A randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, multicentre study during 6 months preceded by a 4 week wash-out and a 3 week run-in placebo period. Quinapril (20 mg) and metoprolol (100 mg, conventional tablets) were given once daily. No change was made in the treatment of diabetes (diet and hypoglycaemic agents).Seventy-two patients fulfilling the criteria were randomized and entered the double-blind period. Twelve patients did not complete the study. Sixty patients, 26 on quinapril and 34 on metoprolol, were available for the final analysis.The effect was assessed by changes in HbA1c, the fasting serum glucose and the post-load serum glucose, C-peptide and insulin levels during the oral glucose tolerance test.In the quinapril group, the fasting serum glucose, oral glucose tolerance and the C-peptide and insulin responses, determined as the incremental area under the curves (AUC), showed no change, but the mean HbA1c level increased from 6.2 +/- 1.1% to 6.5 +/- 1.3% (P < 0.05). In the metoprolol group, the rise in the mean level of HbA1c, from 6.3 +/- 1.0% to 6.8 +/- 1.3% (P < 0.01), tended to be more marked than after quinapril, although there was no significant difference between the increments. The mean fasting serum glucose showed an increase from 9.1 +/- 1.9 mM to 10.1 +/- 2.8 mM (P < 0.01) which correlated significantly with the duration of diabetes (P < 0.01) and the increase in fasting serum triglycerides (P < 0.001). Moreover, in the metoprolol group we found significant decreases in the oral glucose tolerance as well as C-peptide and insulin responses to the glucose load.Treatment with quinapril for 6 months appears to have advantages over metoprolol in NIDDM patients with hypertension. Although treatment with quinapril or metoprolol over 6 months was concomitant with a rise in the HbA1c, increased fasting blood glucose, decreased oral glucose tolerance and decreased C-peptide and insulin responses to a glucose challenge were observed only in patients treated with metoprolol.Effect of telmisartan on paroxysmal atrial fibrillation recurrence in hypertensive patients with normal or increased left atrial size.Hypertension is the most prevalent and potentially modifiable risk factor for atrial fibrillation (AF). In a previous secondary prevention study, the authors observed that the angiotensin II receptor blocker telmisartan was more effective than the calcium channel blocker amlodipine in preventing AF relapse in hypertensive patients with normal atrial size.Telmisartan may be more effective than amlodipine in preventing AF recurrence in hypertensive patients with paroxysmal AF and normal or increased left atrial dimension (LAD).The authors assigned 378 mild hypertensive outpatients in sinus rhythm, but with ≥2 episodes of AF in the previous 6 months, to 1 of 2 groups. Group 1 comprised patients with LAD <40 mm in females and <45 mm in males. Group 2 comprised patients with LAD >40 mm and <45 mm in females and >45 mm and <50 mm in males. In both groups, patients were randomly treated with telmisartan or amlodipine for 1 year.Systolic and diastolic blood pressure were similarly reduced by telmisartan and amlodipine in both groups. The AF recurrence rate was significantly lower in the telmisartan-treated patients than in the amlodipine-treated patients in both group 1 (12 vs 39, P < 0.01) and group 2 (40 vs 59, P < 0.05). Under telmisartan, the AF recurrence rate was significantly lower in group 1 than in group 2 (12.9% vs 42.1%, P < 0.05). Time to a first AF relapse was significantly longer with telmisartan than with amlodipine in both group 1 (176 ± 94 days vs 74 ± 61 days, P < 0.05) and group 2 (119 ± 65 days vs 38 ± 35 days, P < 0.05).Telmisartan was more effective than amlodipine in preventing AF recurrences in hypertensive patients with paroxysmal AF.Effects of amlodipine and lisinopril on intima-media thickness in previously untreated, elderly hypertensive patients (the ELVERA trial).To compare the effects of the calcium channel blocker amlodipine and the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor lisinopril on intima-media thickness (IMT) in elderly, previously untreated hypertensive individuals.A double-blind randomized parallel-group trial (the ELVERA trial).The study population comprised 166 newly diagnosed hypertensive individuals (aged 60-75 years) with diastolic blood pressure between 95 and 115 mmHg or systolic blood pressure between 160 and 220 mmHg, or both.Patients were allocated randomly to groups to receive amlodipine 5-10 mg or lisinopril 10-20 mg for 2 years.Before and after 1 and 2 years of treatment, IMT was measured in three carotid and two femoral arterial sites by B-mode ultrasound. The primary endpoint was the change from baseline of the combined mean maximum far wall IMT of carotid and femoral arteries, evaluated by repeated measurement analysis of the treatment effect in an intention-to-treat analysis.After 2 years of treatment, amlodipine decreased IMT by 0.089 mm [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.144 to 0.037]. Lisinopril decreased IMT by 0.065 mm (95% CI 0.124 to 0.010). No differences between the two drugs were found (P = 0.18). Both treatment regimens achieved the greatest reduction of IMT after 1 year, with a slight increase after the second year, whereas the reduction in blood pressure was maintained. Comparing the carotid and femoral arteries, a significant treatment difference in the change from baseline in favour of amlodipine was observed in the IMT of the elastic common carotid artery (P < 0.05). The effects of the two drugs on the muscular common femoral artery were not different.In a long-term study, amlodipine and lisinopril reduce IMT to a similar extent in newly diagnosed elderly hypertensive patients. It is suggested that the two drugs have different effects on arteries that are not prone to atherosclerosis.Single-drug therapy for hypertension in men. A comparison of six antihypertensive agents with placebo. The Department of Veterans Affairs Cooperative Study Group on Antihypertensive Agents.Characteristics such as age and race are often cited as determinants of the response of blood pressure to specific antihypertensive agents, but this clinically important issue has not been examined in sufficiently large trials, involving all standard treatments, to determine the effect of such factors.In a randomized, double-blind study at 15 clinics, we assigned 1292 men with diastolic blood pressures of 95 to 109 mm Hg, after a placebo washout period, to receive placebo or one of six drugs: hydrochlorothiazide (12.5 to 50 mg per day), atenolol (25 to 100 mg per day), captopril (25 to 100 mg per day), clonidine (0.2 to 0.6 mg per day), a sustained-release preparation of diltiazem (120 to 360 mg per day), or prazosin (4 to 20 mg per day). The drug doses were titrated to a goal of less than 90 mm Hg for maximal diastolic pressure, and the patients continued to receive therapy for at least one year.The mean (+/- SD) age of the randomized patients was 59 +/- 10 years, and 48 percent were black. The average blood pressure at base line was 152 +/- 14/99 +/- 3 mm Hg. Diltiazem therapy had the highest rate of success: 59 percent of the treated patients had reached the blood-pressure goal at the end of the titration phase and had a diastolic blood pressure of less than 95 mm Hg at one year. Atenolol was successful by this definition in 51 percent of the patients, clonidine in 50 percent, hydrochlorothiazide in 46 percent, captopril in 42 percent, and prazosin in 42 percent; all these agents were superior to placebo (success rate, 25 percent). Diltiazem ranked first for younger blacks (< 60 years) and older blacks (> or = 60 years), among whom the success rate was 64 percent, captopril for younger whites (success rate, 55 percent), and atenolol for older whites (68 percent). Drug intolerance was more frequent with clonidine (14 percent) and prazosin (12 percent) than with the other drugs.Among men, race and age have an important effect on the response to single-drug therapy for hypertension. In addition to cost and quality of life, these factors should be considered in the initial choice of a drug.Atrial fibrillation at baseline and during follow-up in ALLHAT (Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial).The ALLHAT (Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial) determined that treatment with amlodipine, lisinopril, or doxazosin was not superior to thiazide-like diuretic (chlorthalidone) in preventing coronary heart disease (CHD) or other cardiovascular events. This subanalysis examines baseline prevalence and in-trial incidence of new-onset atrial fibrillation (AF) or atrial flutter (AFL) and their influence on clinical outcomes.Limited information is available on whether atrial fibrillation incidence is affected differentially by different classes of antihypertensive medications or treatment with statins.AF/AFL was identified from baseline and follow-up electrocardiograms performed biannually. Analyses were performed to identify characteristics associated with baseline AF/AFL and its subsequent incidence.AF/AFL was present at baseline in 423 participants (1.1%), more frequent in men (odds ratio: 1.72; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.37 to 2.17) and nonblacks (odds ratio: 2.09; 95% CI: 1.58 to 2.75). Its prevalence increased with age (p < 0.001) and was associated with CHD, cardiovascular disease, obesity, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol <35 mg/dl. New-onset AF/AFL was associated with the same baseline risk factors plus electrocardiogram left ventricular hypertrophy. It occurred in 641 participants (2.0%) and, excluding doxazosin, did not differ by antihypertensive treatment group or, in a subset of participants, by pravastatin versus usual care. Baseline AF/AFL was associated with increased mortality (hazard ratio [HR]: 2.82; 95% CI: 2.36 to 3.37; p < 0.001), stroke (HR: 3.63; 95% CI: 2.72 to 4.86; p < 0.001), heart failure (HR: 3.17; 95% CI: 2.38 to 4.25; p < 0.001), and fatal CHD or nonfatal myocardial infarction (HR: 1.64; 95% CI: 1.22 to 2.21; p < 0.01). There was a nearly 2.5-fold increase in mortality risk when AF/AFL was present at baseline or developed during the trial (HR: 2.42; 95% CI: 2.11 to 2.77; p < 0.001).In this high-risk hypertensive population, pre-existing and new-onset AF/AFL were associated with increased mortality. Excluding doxazosin, treatment assignment to either antihypertensive drugs or pravastatin versus usual care did not affect AF/AFL incidence. (Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial [ALLHAT]; NCT00000542).Large and small artery endothelial function in patients with essential hypertension--effect of ACE inhibition and beta-blockade.Hypertension has been associated with changes in endothelial function in both large muscular arteries and small resistance arteries. We evaluated the relationship between blood flow velocity and dilatation of the brachial artery following transient forearm ischemia and acetylcholine-induced relaxation in subcutaneous small arteries and the influence of antihypertensive therapy on both in patients with essential hypertension. Thirty-one previously untreated hypertensive patients were randomized in a double-blind fashion to treatment with either the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor perindopril or the beta-blocker atenolol and compared with 17 healthy normotensive controls. Before and after 1 year of treatment, while still on active medication, flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) was measured in the brachial artery using ultrasound while relaxation to acetylcholine in small arteries was tested in vitro in a myograph. FMD correlated inversely to resting brachial artery diameter (r = -0.38, p<0.05). FMD corrected for resting diameter (FMD(corr)) was lower in patients (3.0+/-0.2%) compared with controls (4.2+/-0.3%, p<0.01). In both patients and controls, FMD(corr) was related to flow velocity in a non-linear way with FMD(corr) reaching a maximum despite increasing flow velocities, and in the patients, FMD(corr) was only reduced at high flow velocities. Furthermore, patients had a reduced acetylcholine-induced relaxation in small arteries (p = 0.04). Perindopril and atenolol reduced blood pressure to similar levels and both drugs improved FMD(corr) to a similar degree without any effects on relaxation to acetylcholine in small arteries. The present study demonstrates the role of correcting for differences in baseline diameter during measurements of FMD and a non-linear relationship between flow velocity and FMD in the brachial artery. Furthermore, the results suggest different effects of antihypertensive treatment on endothelial function in large and small arteries.Antihypertensive therapy and cerebral hemodynamics in executive mild cognitive impairment: results of a pilot randomized clinical trial.To compare the effects of three antihypertensive medications on cerebral hemodynamic and cognitive function in hypertensive individuals with executive dysfunction.Double-blind randomized clinical trial.Community.Fifty-three individuals aged 60 and older with hypertension and executive dysfunction.Lisinopril, candesartan, or hydrochlorothiazide for 1 year.Cerebral blood flow velocity (BFV; transcranial Doppler ultrasonography during rest, sitting, standing, hypercapnia, and hypocapnia), cognition, and blood pressure were measured at baseline and after 6 and 12 months. Linear mixed models were used to compare the three groups.Of the 53 participants, 47 had successful insonation (mean age 72; 70% white; 57% women). There was a tendency toward an increase in BFV in the candesartan group and a decrease in the lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide groups (between-group P = .57) that was significant in those with low BFV at baseline (<median 27.6 cm/s, between-group P = .03). The candesartan group also had the greatest improvement in executive function (Trail Making Test Part B improved by 17.1 seconds, vs hydrochlorothiazide improved by 4.2 seconds and lisinopril worsened by 14.4 seconds, P = .008). Carbon dioxide vasoreactivity and vasomotor range declined significantly in the lisinopril (within-group P = .001 for vasoreactivity and .02 for vasomotor range) and hydrochlorothiazide groups (within-group P = .10 and .009, respectively) but not in the candesartan group (within-group P = .25 and .38, respectively; between-group P = .30 and .46, respectively).Angiotensin receptor blockers may preferentially preserve cerebral hemodynamics and executive function in individuals with executive dysfunction. These findings warrant further investigation in a larger trial.Effect of irbesartan versus atenolol on left ventricular mass and voltage: results of the CardioVascular Irbesartan Project.Regression of hypertensive left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is associated with improved prognosis. The aim of this trial was to compare the effects of irbesartan versus atenolol on LVH in subjects with essential hypertension. Because electrocardiographic and echocardiographic parameters of LVH carry disparate prognostic information, both methods were applied in this trial. In the randomized, double-blind, multicenter trial CardioVascular Irbesartan Project, 240 patients with essential hypertension were treated with irbesartan or atenolol for 18 months. Voltage criteria used for LVH were Sokolow index, Cornell index, Cornell voltage x QRS duration product and Lewis index. In parallel, left ventricular mass (LVM) was determined by 2-dimensional guided M-mode echocardiography. After 6 and 18 months, reductions of LVM and voltage criteria for LVH were only found in subjects treated with irbesartan. However, a reduction of LVM was only detectable in subjects within the highest quartile of baseline LVM but not overall. In contrast, reductions of voltage criteria for LVH were detectable after 6 and 18 months even within commonly used normal limits. In conclusion, treatment of hypertension with irbesartan resulted in a significant reduction in the voltage criteria for LVH, although an effect on LVM was only seen in subjects with high baseline LVM. In contrast, atenolol did not lead to reductions in electrocardiographic or echocardiographic parameters of LVH. Because voltage criteria for LVH have been shown to predict cardiovascular outcome independently from LVM, we suggest that both methods should be used to accurately assess the benefits of antihypertensive treatment.Age-race subgroup compared with renin profile as predictors of blood pressure response to antihypertensive therapy. Department of Veterans Affairs Cooperative Study Group on Antihypertensive Agents.Renin profiling and age-race subgroup may help select single-drug therapy for stage 1 and stage 2 hypertension.To compare the plasma renin profiling and age-race subgroup methods as predictors of response to single-drug therapy in men with stage 1 and 2 hypertension as defined by the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation and Treatment of High Blood Pressure.The Veterans Affairs Cooperative Study on Single-Drug Therapy of Hypertension, a randomized controlled trial.Fifteen Veterans Affairs hypertension centers.A total of 1105 ambulatory men with entry diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of 95 to 109 mm Hg, of whom 1031 had valid plasma and urine samples for renin profiling.Randomization to 1 of 6 antihypertensive drugs: hydrochlorothiazide, atenolol, captopril, clonidine, diltiazem (sustained release), or prazosin.Treatment response as assessed by percentage achieving goal DBP (<90 mm Hg) in response to a single drug that corresponded to patients' renin profile vs a single drug that corresponded to patients' age-race subgroup.Clonidine and diltiazem had consistent response rates regardless of renin profile (76%, 67%, and 80% for low, medium, and high renin, respectively, for clonidine and 83%, 82%, and 83%, respectively, for diltiazem for patients with baseline DBP of 95-99 mm Hg). Hydrochlorothiazide and prazosin were best in low- and medium-renin profiles; captopril was best in medium- and high-renin profiles (low-, medium-, and high-renin response rates were 82%, 78%, and 14%, respectively, for hydrochlorothiazide; 88%, 67%, and 40%, respectively, for prazosin; and 51%, 83%, and 100%, respectively, for captopril for patients with baseline DBP of 95-99 mm Hg). Response rates for patients with baseline DBP of 95 to 99 mm Hg by age-race subgroup ranged from 70% for clonidine to 90% for prazosin for younger black men, from 50% for captopril to 97% for diltiazem for older black men, from 70% for hydrochlorothiazide to 92% for atenolol for younger white men, and from 84% for hydrochlorothiazide to 95% for diltiazem for older white men. Patients with a correct treatment for their renin profile but incorrect for age-race subgroup had a response rate of 58.7%; patients with an incorrect treatment for their renin profile but correct for age-race subgroup had a response rate of 63.1% (P = .30). After controlling for DBP and interactions with treatment group, age-race subgroup (P<.001) significantly predicted response to single-drug therapy, whereas renin profile was of borderline significance (P= .05).In these men with stage 1 and stage 2 hypertension, therapeutic responses were consistent with baseline renin profile, but age-race subgroup was a better predictor of response.Changes in aortic pulse wave velocity in hypertensive postmenopausal women: comparison between a calcium channel blocker vs angiotensin receptor blocker regimen.Postmenopausal women are at greater risk for hypertension-related cardiovascular disease. Antihypertensive therapy may help alleviate arterial stiffness that represents a potential modifiable risk factor of hypertension. This randomized controlled study investigated the difference between an angiotensin receptor blocker and a calcium channel blocker in reducing arterial stiffness. Overall, 125 postmenopausal hypertensive women (age, 61.4 ± 6 years; systolic blood pressure/diastolic blood pressure [SBP/DBP], 158 ± 11/92 ± 9 mm Hg) were randomized to valsartan 320 mg ± hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) (n = 63) or amlodipine 10 mg ± HCTZ (n = 62). The primary outcome was carotid-to-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV) changes after 38 weeks of treatment. Both treatments lowered peripheral blood pressure (BP) (-22.9/-10.9 mm Hg for valsartan and -25.2/-11.7 mm Hg for amlodipine, P = not significant) and central BP (-15.7/-7.6 mm Hg for valsartan and -19.2/-10.3 mm Hg for amlodipine, P<.05 for central DBP). Both treatments similarly reduced the carotid-femoral PWV (-1.9 vs -1.7 m/s; P = not significant). Amlodipine was associated with a higher incidence of peripheral edema compared with the valsartan group (77% vs 14%, P<.001). BP lowering in postmenopausal women led to a reduction in arterial stiffness as assessed by PWV measurement. Both regimens reduced PWV to a similar degree after 38 weeks of treatment despite differences in central BP lowering, suggesting that the effect of valsartan on PWV is mediated through nonhemodynamic effects.Aggressive antihypertensive therapy based on hydrochlorothiazide, candesartan or lisinopril as initial choice in hypertensive type II diabetic individuals: effects on albumin excretion, endothelial function and inflammation in a double-blind, randomized clinical trial.We investigated the effects of aggressive antihypertensive therapy based on hydrochlorothiazide, candesartan or lisinopril on urinary albumin excretion, endothelial function and inflammatory activity in hypertensive type II diabetic individuals. A total of 70 hypertensive type II diabetic individuals were treated with three antihypertensive strategies in a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy design. Blood pressure was titrated to levels below 130/85 mmHg or a decrease in systolic pressure of 10% with a diastolic pressure below 85 mmHg. After titration, patients were treated for 12 months. Mean blood pressures changed from 157/93, 151/94 and 149/93 at baseline to 135/80, 135/82 and 131/80 mmHg after titration in the hydrochlorothiazide (n=24), candesartan (n=24) and lisinopril (n=22) groups. About 70% reached target blood pressures. However, only 45% had blood pressures <130/85 mmHg. Urinary albumin excretion and levels of soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 decreased (GEE regression coefficients, -2.40 mg/24 h (P<0.001), -85 ng/ml (P=0.01) and -50 ng/ml (P=0.02)), but brachial artery endothelium-dependent and -independent vasodilation and levels of von Willebrand factor and C-reactive protein did not change (GEE regression coefficients, 0.21 mm (P=0.07), 0.04 mm (P=0.43), 0.04 IU/ml (P=0.33) and -1.15 mg/l (P=0.64)). No differences in outcome variables between treatment groups were observed. These data show that achievement of target blood pressures below 130/85 mmHg in hypertensive type II diabetes is difficult. Aggressive antihypertensive therapy can improve urinary albumin excretion, endothelial function and inflammatory activity in hypertensive type II diabetic individuals, regardless of the type of antihypertensive therapy used.Metabolic and clinical outcomes in nondiabetic individuals with the metabolic syndrome assigned to chlorthalidone, amlodipine, or lisinopril as initial treatment for hypertension: a report from the Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT).Optimal initial antihypertensive drug therapy in people with the metabolic syndrome is unknown.We conducted a subgroup analysis of the Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT) to compare metabolic, cardiovascular, and renal outcomes in individuals assigned to initial hypertension treatment with a thiazide-like diuretic (chlorthalidone), a calcium channel blocker (CCB; amlodipine), or an ACE inhibitor (lisinopril) in nondiabetic individuals with or without metabolic syndrome.In participants with metabolic syndrome, at 4 years of follow-up, the incidence of newly diagnosed diabetes (fasting glucose >or=126 mg/dl) was 17.1% for chlorthalidone, 16.0% for amlodipine (P = 0.49, chlorthalidone vs. amlodipine) and 12.6% for lisinopril (P < 0.05, lisinopril vs. chlorthalidone). For those without metabolic syndrome, the rate of newly diagnosed diabetes was 7.7% for chlorthalidone, 4.2% for amlodipine, and 4.7% for lisinopril (P < 0.05 for both comparisons). There were no differences in relative risks (RRs) for outcomes with amlodipine compared with chlorthalidone in those with metabolic syndrome; in those without metabolic syndrome, there was a higher risk for heart failure (RR 1.55 [95% CI 1.25-1.35]). In comparison with lisinopril, chlorthalidone was superior in those with metabolic syndrome with respect to heart failure (1.31 [1.04-1.64]) and combined cardiovascular disease (CVD) (1.19 [1.07-1.32]). No significant treatment group-metabolic syndrome interaction was noted.Despite a less favorable metabolic profile, thiazide-like diuretic initial therapy for hypertension offers similar, and in some instances possibly superior, CVD outcomes in older hypertensive adults with metabolic syndrome, as compared with treatment with CCBs and ACE inhibitors.Regression of left ventricular hypertrophy in human hypertension with irbesartan.The Swedish irbesartan left ventricular hypertrophy investigation versus atenolol (SILVHIA).Angiotensin II induces myocardial hypertrophy. We hypothesized that blockade of angiotensin II subtype 1 (AT1) receptors by the AT1-receptor antagonist irbesartan would reduce left ventricular mass (as measured by echocardiography) more than conventional treatment with a beta blocker.This double-blind study randomized 115 hypertensive men and women with left ventricular hypertrophy to receive either irbesartan 150 mg q.d. or atenolol 50 mg q.d. for 48 weeks. If diastolic blood pressure remained above 90 mmHg, doses were doubled, and additional medications (hydrochlorothiazide and felodipine) were prescribed as needed. Echocardiography was performed at weeks 0, 12, 24 and 48.Baseline mean blood pressure was 162/ 104 mmHg, and mean left ventricular mass index was 157 g/m2 for men and 133 g/m2 for women. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure reductions were similar in both treatment groups. Both irbesartan (P < 0.001) and atenolol (P< 0.001) progressively reduced left ventricular mass index, e.g. by 26 and 14 g/m2 (16 and 9%), respectively, at week 48, with a greater reduction in the irbesartan group (P = 0.024). The proportion of patients who attained a normalized left ventricular mass (i.e. < or = 131 g/m2 for men and < or = 100 g/m2 for women) tended to be greater with irbesartan (47 versus 32%, P = 0.108).Left ventricular mass was reduced more in the irbesartan group than in the atenolol group. These results suggest that blocking the action of angiotensin II at AT1-receptors may be an important mechanism, beyond that of lowering blood pressure, in the regulation of left ventricular mass and geometry in patients with hypertension.A comparison of the effect of ramipril, felodipine and placebo on glomerular filtration rate, albuminuria, blood pressure and vasoactive hormones in chronic glomerulonephritis. A randomized, prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled study over two years.The effects of an ACE-inhibitor (ramipril), a calcium antagonist (felodipine) and placebo on glomerular filtration rate (GFR), urinary albumin/creatinine ratio, blood pressure (BP) and vasoactive hormones were investigated in a randomized, prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of patients with chronic glomerulonephritis and hypertension, with measurements at entrance and after 12 and 24 months. In total, 33 patients were included: 21 completed the study with 7 patients in each group. GFR was measured as 51Cr-EDTA clearance and the vasoactive hormones with radioimmunoassays. The reduction in GFR was significantly more pronounced in the felodipine group (-7 ml/min) than in the ramipril group (0 ml/min) but the same as in the placebo group (-6 ml/min). The urinary albumin/creatinine ratio was significantly more reduced in the ramipril group (-74 mg/mmol) than in the placebo group (-11 mg/mmol), which did not deviate from the felodipine group (-10 mg/mmol). BP was significantly reduced by ramipril and felodipine, but not by placebo. Angiotensin II and aldosterone in plasma increased or tended to increase in the felodipine and placebo groups, but were unchanged in the ramipril group. Endothelin increased only in the placebo group, and vasopressin, atrial natriuretic peptide, and brain natriuretic peptide were not significantly changed in any of the groups. It is concluded that ramipril seems to be superior to felodipine in chronic glomerulonephritis owing to better preservation of GFR.Clinical outcomes by race in hypertensive patients with and without the metabolic syndrome: Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT).Antihypertensive drugs with favorable metabolic effects are advocated for first-line therapy in hypertensive patients with metabolic/cardiometabolic syndrome (MetS). We compared outcomes by race in hypertensive individuals with and without MetS treated with a thiazide-type diuretic (chlorthalidone), a calcium channel blocker (amlodipine besylate), an alpha-blocker (doxazosin mesylate), or an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (lisinopril).A subgroup analysis of the Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT), a randomized, double-blind hypertension treatment trial of 42 418 participants. We defined MetS as hypertension plus at least 2 of the following: fasting serum glucose level of at least 100 mg/dL, body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) of at least 30, fasting triglyceride levels of at least 150 mg/dL, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels of less than 40 mg/dL in men or less than 50 mg/dL in women.Significantly higher rates of heart failure were consistent across all treatment comparisons in those with MetS. Relative risks (RRs) were 1.50 (95% confidence interval, 1.18-1.90), 1.49 (1.17-1.90), and 1.88 (1.42-2.47) in black participants and 1.25 (1.06-1.47), 1.20 (1.01-1.41), and 1.82 (1.51-2.19) in nonblack participants for amlodipine, lisinopril, and doxazosin comparisons with chlorthalidone, respectively. Higher rates for combined cardiovascular disease were observed with lisinopril-chlorthalidone (RRs, 1.24 [1.09-1.40] and 1.10 [1.02-1.19], respectively) and doxazosin-chlorthalidone comparisons (RRs, 1.37 [1.19-1.58] and 1.18 [1.08-1.30], respectively) in black and nonblack participants with MetS. Higher rates of stroke were seen in black participants only (RR, 1.37 [1.07-1.76] for the lisinopril-chlorthalidone comparison, and RR, 1.49 [1.09-2.03] for the doxazosin-chlorthalidone comparison). Black patients with MetS also had higher rates of end-stage renal disease (RR, 1.70 [1.13-2.55]) with lisinopril compared with chlorthalidone.The ALLHAT findings fail to support the preference for calcium channel blockers, alpha-blockers, or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors compared with thiazide-type diuretics in patients with the MetS, despite their more favorable metabolic profiles. This was particularly true for black participants.Greater regression of electrocardiographic left ventricular hypertrophy during hydrochlorothiazide therapy in hypertensive patients.Treatment of hypertensive patients with a losartan-based regimen was associated with greater regression of electrocardiographic (ECG) left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) than atenolol-based therapy in the Losartan Intervention for Endpoint Reduction in Hypertension (LIFE) study, independent of blood pressure (BP) changes. However, whether concomitant hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) therapy in >70% of LIFE patients was associated with greater regression of LVH independent of BP changes and whether this effect differed between treatment arms has not been examined.Changes in Cornell product and Sokolow-Lyon voltage LVH were assessed in 9,193 hypertensive patients randomly assigned to treatment with losartan or atenolol, with additional HCTZ therapy added as necessary to achieve target BP goal per study protocol.After controlling for baseline and change in systolic and diastolic pressure, age, sex, race, prior antihypertensive treatment, baseline and year-4 body mass index and baseline LVH by either Cornell product or Sokolow-Lyon voltage, at year-4 follow-up HCTZ therapy was associated with greater regression of Cornell product LVH (-244 +/- 788 vs. -172 +/- 771 mm.msec, P < 0.05) and Sokolow-Lyon voltage (-4.2 +/- 6.7 vs. -3.0 +/- 7.0 mm, P < 0.001) and this effect was significantly greater in patients on losartan (-341 +/- 743 vs. -189 +/- 775 mm.msec and -5.2 +/- 6.6 vs. -3.3 +/- 6.6 mm) than in patients on atenolol (-142 +/- 822 vs. -158 +/- 765 mm.msec and -3.1 +/- 6.6 vs. -2.7 +/- 7.4 mm; both P < 0.001 for interaction of HCTZ with losartan vs. atenolol therapy).HCTZ use was associated with greater regression of ECG LVH and this effect was greater in patients on losartan- than atenolol-based therapy, independent of baseline severity of ECG LVH and hypertension and changes in BP.Antihypertensive Effect and Tolerability of Perindopril in Indian Hypertensive and Type 2 Diabetic Patients: 1-Year Randomised, Double-Blind, Parallel Study vs Atenolol.This study compared the antihypertensive effect and acceptability of a perindopril-based group with that of an atenolol-based group in Indian hypertensive type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) diabetic patients.100 ambulant patients aged between 35 and 69 years were recruited into this monocentric, randomised, double-blind study in two parallel groups for 1 year after a 1-month washout period on placebo. The setting was a tertiary care institution.All patients had stable, essential hypertension between 95mm Hg and 115mm Hg, type 2 diabetes with glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA(1C)) <12%, and albuminuria between 300mg and 3.5g/24 hours. There were 50 patients per treatment group and two patient population groups were studied, intention-to-treat (ITT) and per-protocol (PP). The former constituted all patients, whilst the latter included those without major protocol deviation and who completed the 12-month study.The study drugs were perindopril 4 to 8mg once daily or atenolol 50 to 100mg once daily. In each group therapeutic adjustment was planned by doubling the dose and then by the addition of hydrochlorothiazide 25mg daily. Nifedipine 30 to 60mg daily was subsequently added if the desired drop in blood pressure was not obtained. The ITT group was analysed by Student's t-test, and a 2-way analysis of variance was performed for the PP population.A comparison of the control of hypertension, biochemical abnormalities, blood sugar and adverse effects was performed in the atenolol group versus the perindopril group.On single-dose therapy after 1 month 17 patients (60%) had normal blood pressure [diastolic blood pressure (DBP) </=90mm Hg] on atenolol 50mg daily, while 13% (30.23%) had normal blood pressure (DBP </=90mm Hg) on perindopril 4mg daily (p = 0.013). In the ITT group the sitting systolic blood pressure (SBP) decreased by 14.4 +/- 22.3mm Hg at the end of the treatment period on atenolol from 174.4 +/- 17.9mm Hg at the initial period, and the sitting SBP decreased by 21.6 +/- 20.3mm Hg at the end of perindopril treatment from an initial value of 172.1 +/- 20.3mm Hg (probability 0.091). The sitting DBP decreased by 18.6 +/- 8.7mm Hg on atenolol from 100.5 +/- 4.8mm Hg at the initial period and by 15.8 +/- 9.1mm Hg on perindopril from 100.6 +/- 5.2mm Hg (probability 0.112). Glycaemic control was similar for HbA(1C) fasting and postprandial glucose in the ITT population, while fasting glucose increased over time from 10.7 +/- 4.1 to 12.0 +/- 3.4 mmol/L; p < 0.001 in the PP population in the atenolol group.The percentage of normalised patients (sitting DBP </=90mm Hg) was similar in both groups. Patients on perindopril monotherapy required more additional antihypertensive drugs compared with atenolol monotherapy. There was a significant increase in fasting blood sugar in the atenolol-based group (p < 0.001).Effects of losartan compared with atenolol on lipids in patients with hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy: the Losartan Intervention For Endpoint reduction in hypertension study.Beta-blockers and angiotensin II receptor blockers have different effects on lipids.We examined lipid levels in the Losartan Intervention For Endpoint reduction in hypertension study and their impact on the primary composite endpoint of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke. We measured total and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol at baseline and annually during 4.8 years of losartan-based compared with atenolol-based treatment in 8611 patients with hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy.Patients randomized to losartan-based or atenolol-based treatment had similar baseline total (6.04 +/- 1.12 vs. 6.05 +/- 1.13 mmol/l, NS) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (1.50 +/- 0.44 vs. 1.49 +/- 0.44 mmol/l, NS). Total cholesterol decreased significantly but equally (-0.37 +/- 1.05 vs. -0.34 +/- 1.09 mmol/l, NS), whereas HDL cholesterol decreased less during the first 2 years in patients randomized to losartan compared with atenolol (-0.13 +/- 0.24 vs. -0.19 +/- 0.25 mmol/l) and remained higher each year (1.38, 1.37, 1.42, 1.47, and 1.48 mmol/l vs. 1.32, 1.30, 1.36, 1.40, and 1.42 mmol/l, all P < 0.001) independent of hydrochlorothiazide or statin treatment. In Cox regression analysis, baseline total cholesterol [hazard ratio (HR) = 1.08 (1.02-1.14) per mmol/l, P < 0.01], HDL cholesterol [HR = 0.56 (0.48-0.66) per mmol/l, P < 0.001], and treatment allocation [HR = 0.86 (0.76-0.98), P < 0.05] predicted composite endpoint independently. Using time-varying analyses, the predictive strength of HDL cholesterol was increased [HR = 0.36 (0.30-0.44) per mmol/l, P < 0.001], whereas that of total cholesterol [HR = 1.03 (0.97-1.09) per mmol/l, NS] and treatment allocation [HR = 0.91 (0.80-1.03), NS] were reduced.Losartan blunted the decrease in HDL cholesterol during antihypertensive treatment in the LIFE study. Higher intreatment HDL cholesterol was associated with fewer composite endpoints and may partly explain the better outcome of losartan-based treatment.Antihypertensive pharmacogenetic effect of fibrinogen-beta variant -455G>A on cardiovascular disease, end-stage renal disease, and mortality: the GenHAT study.The FGB gene codes for fibrinogen-beta, a polypeptide of the coagulation factor fibrinogen, which is positively associated with cardiovascular diseases. Studies show that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors lower plasma fibrinogen concentrations, whereas diuretics and calcium-channel blockers do not. As carriers of the FGB-455 minor 'A' allele have higher levels of fibrinogen while ACE inhibitors lower it, we hypothesize that 'A' allele carriers benefit more from antihypertensive treatment with ACE inhibitors than calcium-channel blockers or diuretics, relative to 'GG' genotype individuals.The Genetics of Hypertension Associated Treatment (GenHAT) study [ancillary to Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT)] genotyped hypertensive participants for several hypertension-related candidate genes, making this a post-hoc analysis of a randomized trial. In total, 90.1% of the ALLHAT population was successfully genotyped for FGB-455. We included participants (n=30 076) randomized to one of three antihypertensive medications (lisinopril, amlodipine, chlorthalidone), with two treatment comparisons: lisinopril versus chlorthalidone and lisinopril versus amlodipine. The primary outcome of ALLHAT/GenHAT was coronary heart disease, defined as fatal coronary heart disease or non-fatal myocardial infarction, and secondary outcomes included stroke, heart failure, all-cause mortality, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) with mean follow-up time of 4.9 years. Genotype-by-treatment interactions (pharmacogenetic effects) were tested with the Cox regression.Stroke: common 'GG' homozygotes had higher risk on lisinopril versus amlodipine [hazard ratio (HR)=1.38, P<0.001], whereas minor 'A' allele carriers had slightly lower risk (HR=0.96, P=0.76; P value for interaction=0.03). Mortality: 'GG' homozygotes had higher risk on lisinopril versus amlodipine (HR=1.12, P=0.02) or chlorthalidone (1.05, P=0.23), whereas 'A' allele carriers had slightly lower risk (HR=0.92, P=0.33 for lisinopril versus amlodipine; HR=0.88, P=0.08 for lisinopril versus chlorthalidone; P value for interactions 0.04 and 0.03, respectively). ESRD: 'GG' homozygotes had higher risk on lisinopril versus chlorthalidone (HR=1.27, P=0.08), whereas 'A' allele carriers had lower risk (HR=0.64, P=0.12; P value for interaction=0.03).There was evidence of pharmacogenetic effects of FGB-455 on stroke, ESRD, and mortality, suggesting that relative to those homozygous for the common allele, variant allele carriers of the FGB gene at position -455 have a better outcome if randomized to lisinopril than chlorthalidone (for mortality and ESRD) or amlodipine (for mortality and stroke). For the models in which a pharmacogenetic effect was observed, the outcome rates among 'GG' homozygotes were higher in those randomized to lisinopril versus amlodipine or chlorthalidone, whereas minor 'A' allele carriers had lower event rates when randomized to lisinopril versus the other medications.Pulse pressure, left ventricular function and cardiovascular events during antihypertensive treatment (the LIFE study).Pulse pressure (PP) has been related to risk of cardiovascular events in hypertension. However, less is known about modification of this risk marker during antihypertensive treatment in patients with left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy.Associations of in-treatment PP with LV systolic function and cardiovascular events was assessed in 883 patients with electrocardiographic LV hypertrophy during 4.8 years of randomized losartan- or atenolol-based treatment within the echocardiographic substudy of the Losartan Intervention For Endpoint reduction in hypertension (LIFE) study.PP was similarly reduced by both treatments. In different multiple regression models, lower in-treatment PP was independently associated with lower in-treatment LV ejection fraction (beta=0.16), stress-corrected midwall shortening (beta=0.20), stroke volume (beta=0.11) and cardiac index (beta=0.07, all p<0.05). In time-varying Cox regression models, 10 mmHg lower in-treatment PP was associated with a 28% higher rate of cardiovascular events [hazard ratio, HR = 1.28 (1.09 - 1.52), p<0.01] independent of in-treatment LV mass and ejection fraction, history of ischemic heart disease, Framingham risk score and study treatment allocation.During systematic antihypertensive treatment in hypertensive patients with electrocardiographic LV hypertrophy, lower in-treatment PP was associated with lower in-treatment LV function and cardiac output as well as higher rate of cardiovascular events.A randomized and double-blind comparison of isradipine and spirapril as monotherapy and in combination on the decline in renal function in patients with chronic renal failure and hypertension.Treatment of hypertension in patients with chronic renal failure has been shown to postpone the decline in renal function. Treatment with an ACE inhibitor has been shown to be superior to conventional antihypertensive treatment, but it is not known how an ACE inhibitor compares to treatment with a calcium channel blocker or to treatment with a combination of these drugs. The aim of the study was to evaluate the rate of decline in GFR in patients with chronic renal failure and hypertension treated with isradipine and spirapril as monotherapy and in combination.Sixty patients with chronic renal failure and hypertension were enrolled in the study. After enrollment, patients were followed prospectively for 6 months in the outpatient clinic on their usual antihypertensive medication, and then randomized to a double-blinded comparison of either spirapril 6 mg daily, isradipine 5 mg daily or spirapril 3 mg and isradipine 2.5 mg daily. After randomization, patients were followed for 21 months or until the need for dialysis. Every 3 months before and 3.5 months after randomization the glomerular filtration rate was measured by 51Cr-EDTA clearance and the effective renal plasma flow evaluated using the renal clearance of paraaminohippuric acid.Blood pressure and the decline in glomerular filtration rate did not differ between the groups before randomization. After randomization, the mean decline in the glomerular filtration rate was -0.32 ml/(min x month x 1.73 m2) in the spirapril group, -0.58 ml/(min x month x 1.73 m2) in the isradipine group and -0.14 ml/(min x month x 1.73 m2) in the combination group (p = 0.38). Twelve patients, 4 in each group, reached end-stage renal failure. No significant difference was found with respect to diastolic (p = 0.10) or systolic blood pressure (p = 0.08) during the treatment period, but a trend towards a better blood pressure control in the combination group was present. During treatment, the rate of decline in renal plasma flow did not differ significantly between the groups (p = 0.09), neither did the changes in filtration fraction (FF) (p = 0.58) nor the mean FF (p = 0.22) during the treatment.Our study indicated differences between the 3 treatment modalities in favor of combined therapy with respect to both the rate of decline in GFR and blood pressure control, but the differences where insignificant. Thus, the treatments might differ, but we were unable to confirm this because of large variation in GFR and small sample size.Prevention of metabolic disorders with telmisartan and indapamide in a Chinese population with high-normal blood pressure.High-normal blood pressure is considered a precursor of stage 1 hypertension that is associated with metabolic disorders. This study aims to investigate whether the pharmacologic treatment of high-normal blood pressure affects metabolism, especially in abdominally obese individuals, and the pharmacoeconomics of two antihypertensive agents, telmisartan and indapamide. Subjects with high-normal blood pressure were randomly assigned to receive telmisartan, indapamide or placebo for 3 years. All the subjects were instructed to modify their lifestyle to reduce blood pressure throughout the study. A total of 221 subjects were randomly assigned to telmisartan, 213 to indapamide and 230 to placebo. After the 3-year intervention, blood pressure was lower in the telmisartan and indapamide groups (P<0.05), FPG in the telmisartan group was lower during the first 2 years (P<0.05) and no characteristic differences were found in those with abdominal obesity among the three groups (P>0.05). The percentage of subjects with metabolic syndrome was significantly decreased in the telmisartan and indapamide groups (P<0.05), but was only significantly decreased in the telmisartan group for subjects with abdominal obesity (P<0.05). The acquisition cost for telmisartan was ~1.86 times higher than for indapamide for a similar antihypertensive effect. The intervention for high-normal blood pressure with telmisartan and indapamide appeared to be feasible and reduced the risk of metabolic syndrome. Telmisartan was more effective, whereas indapamide had better pharmacoeconomic benefits.Major outcomes in high-risk hypertensive patients randomized to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or calcium channel blocker vs diuretic: The Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT).Antihypertensive therapy is well established to reduce hypertension-related morbidity and mortality, but the optimal first-step therapy is unknown.To determine whether treatment with a calcium channel blocker or an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor lowers the incidence of coronary heart disease (CHD) or other cardiovascular disease (CVD) events vs treatment with a diuretic.The Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT), a randomized, double-blind, active-controlled clinical trial conducted from February 1994 through March 2002.A total of 33 357 participants aged 55 years or older with hypertension and at least 1 other CHD risk factor from 623 North American centers.Participants were randomly assigned to receive chlorthalidone, 12.5 to 25 mg/d (n = 15 255); amlodipine, 2.5 to 10 mg/d (n = 9048); or lisinopril, 10 to 40 mg/d (n = 9054) for planned follow-up of approximately 4 to 8 years.The primary outcome was combined fatal CHD or nonfatal myocardial infarction, analyzed by intent-to-treat. Secondary outcomes were all-cause mortality, stroke, combined CHD (primary outcome, coronary revascularization, or angina with hospitalization), and combined CVD (combined CHD, stroke, treated angina without hospitalization, heart failure [HF], and peripheral arterial disease).Mean follow-up was 4.9 years. The primary outcome occurred in 2956 participants, with no difference between treatments. Compared with chlorthalidone (6-year rate, 11.5%), the relative risks (RRs) were 0.98 (95% CI, 0.90-1.07) for amlodipine (6-year rate, 11.3%) and 0.99 (95% CI, 0.91-1.08) for lisinopril (6-year rate, 11.4%). Likewise, all-cause mortality did not differ between groups. Five-year systolic blood pressures were significantly higher in the amlodipine (0.8 mm Hg, P =.03) and lisinopril (2 mm Hg, P<.001) groups compared with chlorthalidone, and 5-year diastolic blood pressure was significantly lower with amlodipine (0.8 mm Hg, P<.001). For amlodipine vs chlorthalidone, secondary outcomes were similar except for a higher 6-year rate of HF with amlodipine (10.2% vs 7.7%; RR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.25-1.52). For lisinopril vs chlorthalidone, lisinopril had higher 6-year rates of combined CVD (33.3% vs 30.9%; RR, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.05-1.16); stroke (6.3% vs 5.6%; RR, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.02-1.30); and HF (8.7% vs 7.7%; RR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.07-1.31).Thiazide-type diuretics are superior in preventing 1 or more major forms of CVD and are less expensive. They should be preferred for first-step antihypertensive therapy.Outcomes in hypertensive black and nonblack patients treated with chlorthalidone, amlodipine, and lisinopril.Few cardiovascular outcome data are available for blacks with hypertension treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or calcium channel blockers (CCBs).To determine whether an ACE inhibitor or CCB is superior to a thiazide-type diuretic in reducing cardiovascular disease (CVD) incidence in racial subgroups.Prespecified subgroup analysis of ALLHAT, a randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, clinical outcome trial conducted between February 1994 and March 2002 in 33,357 hypertensive US and Canadian patients aged 55 years or older (35% black) with at least 1 other cardiovascular risk factor.Antihypertensive regimens initiated with a CCB (amlodipine) or an ACE inhibitor (lisinopril) vs a thiazide-type diuretic (chlorthalidone). Other medications were added to achieve goal blood pressures (BPs) less than 140/90 mm Hg.The primary outcome was combined fatal coronary heart disease (CHD) or nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), analyzed by intention-to-treat. Secondary outcomes included all-cause mortality, stroke, combined CVD (CHD death, nonfatal MI, stroke, angina, coronary revascularization, heart failure [HF], or peripheral vascular disease), and end-stage renal disease.No significant difference was found between treatment groups for the primary CHD outcome in either racial subgroup. For amlodipine vs chlorthalidone only, HF was the only prespecified clinical outcome that differed significantly (overall: relative risk [RR], 1.37; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.24-1.51; blacks: RR, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.24-1.73; nonblacks: RR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.17-1.49; P<.001 for each comparison) with no difference in treatment effects by race (P = .38 for interaction). For lisinopril vs chlorthalidone, results differed by race for systolic BP (greater decrease in blacks with chlorthalidone), stroke, and combined CVD outcomes (P<.001, P = .01, and P = .04, respectively, for interactions). In blacks and nonblacks, respectively, the RRs for stroke were 1.40 (95% CI, 1.17-1.68) and 1.00 (95% CI, 0.85-1.17) and for combined CVD were 1.19 (95% CI, 1.09-1.30) and 1.06 (95% CI, 1.00-1.13). For HF, the RRs were 1.30 (95% CI, 1.10-1.54) and 1.13 (95% CI, 1.00-1.28), with no significant interaction by race. Time-dependent BP adjustment did not significantly alter differences in outcome for lisinopril vs chlorthalidone in blacks.In blacks and nonblack subgroups, rates were not lower in the amlodipine or lisinopril groups than in the chlorthalidone group for either the primary CHD or any other prespecified clinical outcome, and diuretic-based treatment resulted in the lowest risk of heart failure. While the improved outcomes with chlorthalidone were more pronounced for some outcomes in blacks than in nonblacks, thiazide-type diuretics remain the drugs of choice for initial therapy of hypertension in both black and nonblack hypertensive patients.Comparison of actions of irbesartan versus atenolol on cardiac repolarization in hypertensive left ventricular hypertrophy: results from the Swedish Irbesartan Left Ventricular Hypertrophy Investigation Versus Atenolol (SILVHIA).Left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy is associated with a substantial risk for malignant arrhythmias and sudden death. The effects of antihypertensive therapy on QT dispersion, which reflects cardiac repolarization heterogeneity, in relation to changes in LV mass has not been well studied. Repeat echocardiography and QT measurements (standard 12-lead electrocardiograms) were performed in hypertensive patients with LV hypertrophy, who were randomized double-blind to receive the angiotensin II type 1-receptor blocker irbesartan (n = 44) or the beta(1)-receptor blocker atenolol (n = 48) for 48 weeks, and in 37 matched hypertensive control subjects without LV hypertrophy. LV mass index was related to QT dispersion (r = 0.34, p <0.001). The reduction in LV mass was greater using irbesartan than using atenolol (-27 +/- 28 vs -15 +/- 21 g/m(2) at 48 weeks, p = 0.021), with similar reductions in blood pressure. Irbesartan decreased QT dispersion (from 56 +/- 24 ms to 45 +/- 20 ms at 48 weeks; p <0.001) and QTc dispersion (from 57 +/- 24 to 44 +/- 19 ms at 48 weeks; p <0.001). In contrast, atenolol had minor effects. The decreases in QT and QTc dispersions were greater using irbesartan than using atenolol (p = 0.001 and p = 0.011, respectively); the same results were found when changes in LV mass, blood pressure, and heart rate were also included in multivariate analyses. Thus, heterogeneity of ventricular repolarization is related to the degree of LV hypertrophy. Irbesartan, but not atenolol, reduces QT and QTc dispersions independent of changes in LV mass, blood pressure, or heart rate, and thus seems to induce structural and electrical remodeling in a direction that could decrease the risk of fatal events in hypertensive patients.Outcomes in hypertensive patients at high cardiovascular risk treated with regimens based on valsartan or amlodipine: the VALUE randomised trial.The Valsartan Antihypertensive Long-term Use Evaluation (VALUE) trial was designed to test the hypothesis that for the same blood-pressure control, valsartan would reduce cardiac morbidity and mortality more than amlodipine in hypertensive patients at high cardiovascular risk.15?245 patients, aged 50 years or older with treated or untreated hypertension and high risk of cardiac events participated in a randomised, double-blind, parallel-group comparison of therapy based on valsartan or amlodipine. Duration of treatment was event-driven and the trial lasted until at least 1450 patients had reached a primary endpoint, defined as a composite of cardiac mortality and morbidity. Patients from 31 countries were followed up for a mean of 4.2 years.Blood pressure was reduced by both treatments, but the effects of the amlodipine-based regimen were more pronounced, especially in the early period (blood pressure 4.0/2.1 mm Hg lower in amlodipine than valsartan group after 1 month; 1.5/1.3 mm Hg after 1 year; p<0.001 between groups). The primary composite endpoint occurred in 810 patients in the valsartan group (10.6%, 25.5 per 1000 patient-years) and 789 in the amlodipine group (10.4%, 24.7 per 1000 patient-years; hazard ratio 1.04, 95% CI 0.94-1.15, p=0.49).The main outcome of cardiac disease did not differ between the treatment groups. Unequal reductions in blood pressure might account for differences between the groups in cause-specific outcomes. The findings emphasise the importance of prompt blood-pressure control in hypertensive patients at high cardiovascular risk.A double-blind comparison of the effects of carvedilol and captopril on serum lipid concentrations in patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension and dyslipidaemia.We have studied 250 patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension (diastolic blood pressure 95-114 mmHg) and dyslipidaemia (high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) below 1.03 mmol.l-1, total cholesterol 5.17-9.05 mmol.l-1, and triglycerides 2.26-5.64 mmol.l-1) in a controlled double-blind, multicentre, parallel group trial. The patients took a fat-modified diet. After a 4-week placebo period, patients who continued to fulfil the selection criteria were randomly allocated to treatment with either carvedilol (a vasodilating beta-blocker) 25-50 mg o.d. (n = 116) or captopril (an ACE inhibitor) 25-50 mg o.d. (n = 117) for 6 months. In both groups there were favourable effects on the serum lipids. The relative changes (medians) in the carvedilol and captopril group were respectively: increase in HDL-C by 11% and 8%, decrease in total cholesterol by 11% and 10%, in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol by 16% and 12%, and in triglycerides by 13% and 14%. Equivalence of the two treatments was confirmed for the target variable change in HDL-C at a significance level of 5%. Reductions in supine systolic/diastolic blood pressures were comparable in the two groups (carvedilol: 23/19 mmHg, captopril: 20/18 mmHg). The improvement in lipid metabolism in patients treated with carvedilol is probably due to its alpha 1-blocking properties.Stroke reduction in hypertensive adults with cardiac hypertrophy randomized to losartan versus atenolol: the Losartan Intervention For Endpoint reduction in hypertension study.The Losartan Intervention For Endpoint reduction in hypertension (LIFE) study showed that treatment with the angiotensin II type-1 receptor antagonist losartan reduces overall stroke risk compared with conventional therapy with the beta-blocker atenolol. We conducted secondary analyses in LIFE to determine the extent to which the cerebrovascular benefits of losartan apply to different clinical subgroups and stroke subtypes and to assess the dependence of these benefits on baseline and time-varying covariates. Among 9193 hypertensive patients with electrocardiographic evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy, random allocation to losartan-based treatment lowered the risk of fatal (hazard ratio [HR], 0.65; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.43 to 0.96; P=0.032) and atherothrombotic stroke (HR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.59 to 0.88; P=0.001) compared with atenolol-based therapy. Although comparable risk reductions occurred for hemorrhagic and embolic stroke, these were not statistically significant. The number of neurological deficits per stroke was similar, but there were fewer strokes in the losartan group for nearly every level of stroke severity. Effects were consistent in all clinical subgroups except for those defined by age and ethnicity. The benefits of losartan on all strokes were independent of baseline and time-varying risk factors, including blood pressure. The number needed to treat for 5 years to prevent 1 stroke was 54 for the average participant, declining to 25, 24, and 9 for patients with cerebrovascular disease, isolated systolic hypertension, and atrial fibrillation, respectively. In conclusion, substantial cerebrovascular benefit could be realized with the institution of losartan-based therapy over conventional therapy among hypertensive patients with left ventricular hypertrophy across the spectrum of cardiovascular risk.Role of diuretics in the prevention of heart failure: the Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial.Hypertension is a major cause of heart failure (HF) and is antecedent in 91% of cases. The Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT) stipulated assessment of the relative effect of chlorthalidone, lisinopril, and amlodipine in preventing HF.ALLHAT was a double-blind, randomized, clinical trial in 33,357 high-risk hypertensive patients aged > or =55 years. Hospitalized/fatal HF outcomes were examined with proportional-hazards models. Relative risks (95% confidence intervals; P values) of amlodipine or lisinopril versus chlorthalidone were 1.35 (1.21 to 1.50; <0.001) and 1.11 (0.99 to 1.24; 0.09). The proportional hazards assumption of constant relative risk over time was not valid. A more appropriate model showed relative risks of amlodipine or lisinopril versus chlorthalidone during year 1 were 2.22 (1.69 to 2.91; <0.001) and 2.08 (1.58 to 2.74; <0.001), and after year 1, 1.22 (1.08 to 1.38; P=0.001) and 0.96 (0.85 to 1.10; 0.58). There was no significant interaction between prior medication use and treatment. Baseline blood pressures were equivalent (146/84 mm Hg) and at year 1 were 137/79, 139/79, and 140/80 mm Hg in those given chlorthalidone, amlodipine, and lisinopril. At 1 year, use of added open-label atenolol, diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and calcium channel blockers in the treatment groups was similar.HF risk decreased with chlorthalidone versus amlodipine or lisinopril use during year 1. Subsequently, risk for those individuals taking chlorthalidone versus amlodipine remained decreased but less so, whereas it was equivalent to those given lisinopril. Prior medication use, follow-up blood pressures, and concomitant medications are unlikely to explain most of the HF differences. Diuretics are superior to calcium channel blockers and, at least in the short term, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in preventing HF in hypertensive individuals.Heart failure with preserved and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction in the antihypertensive and lipid-lowering treatment to prevent heart attack trial.Heart failure (HF) developing in hypertensive patients may occur with preserved or reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (PEF [>or=50%] or REF [<50%]). In the Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT), 42 418 high-risk hypertensive patients were randomized to chlorthalidone, amlodipine, lisinopril, or doxazosin, providing an opportunity to compare these treatments with regard to occurrence of hospitalized HFPEF or HFREF.HF diagnostic criteria were prespecified in the ALLHAT protocol. EF estimated by contrast ventriculography, echocardiography, or radionuclide study was available in 910 of 1367 patients (66.6%) with hospitalized events meeting ALLHAT criteria. Cox regression models adjusted for baseline characteristics were used to examine treatment differences for HF (overall and by PEF and REF). HF case fatality rates were examined. Of those with EF data, 44.4% had HFPEF and 55.6% had HFREF. Chlorthalidone reduced the risk of HFPEF compared with amlodipine, lisinopril, or doxazosin; the hazard ratios were 0.69 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.53 to 0.91; P=0.009), 0.74 (95% CI, 0.56 to 0.97; P=0.032), and 0.53 (95% CI, 0.38 to 0.73; P<0.001), respectively. Chlorthalidone reduced the risk of HFREF compared with amlodipine or doxazosin; the hazard ratios were 0.74 (95% CI, 0.59 to 0.94; P=0.013) and 0.61 (95% CI, 0.47 to 0.79; P<0.001), respectively. Chlorthalidone was similar to lisinopril with regard to incidence of HFREF (hazard ratio, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.82 to 1.40; P=0.596). After HF onset, death occurred in 29.2% of participants (chlorthalidone/amlodipine/lisinopril) with new-onset HFPEF versus 41.9% in those with HFREF (P<0.001; median follow-up, 1.74 years); and in the chlorthalidone/doxazosin comparison that was terminated early, 20.0% of HFPEF and 26.0% of HFREF patients died (P=0.185; median follow-up, 1.55 years).In ALLHAT, with adjudicated outcomes, chlorthalidone significantly reduced the occurrence of new-onset hospitalized HFPEF and HFREF compared with amlodipine and doxazosin. Chlorthalidone also reduced the incidence of new-onset HFPEF compared with lisinopril. Among high-risk hypertensive men and women, HFPEF has a better prognosis than HFREF.Effects of enalapril/lercanidipine combination on some emerging biomarkers in cardiovascular risk stratification in hypertensive patients.There is considerable interest in pharmacogenetic and molecular biomarkers. Our aim was to evaluate the effects of enalapril/lercanidipine combination on some emerging biomarkers for cardiovascular risk stratification of hypertensive patients, such as lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)], soluble advanced glycation end products (sRAGE), soluble CD40 ligand (sCD40L) and serum myeloperoxidase (MPO).Three hundred and forty-five patients were enrolled in this randomized, double-blind, clinical trial: 120 hypertensive patients were randomized to enalapril 20 mg, 110 to lercanidipine 10 mg and 115 to enalapril/lercanidipine 20/10 mg fixed combination. We measures the following markers at baseline and after 6, 12, 18 and 24 months: blood pressure, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), lipid profile, Lp(a), sRAGE, sCD40L and MPO.There was a decrease in blood pressure in all groups compared with baseline, even if, as expected, enalapril/lercanidipine combination was more effective in reducing blood pressure compared with the monotherapies. No variations in lipid profile or FPG were recorded in any of the groups. Lercanidipine, but not enalapril, improved Lp(a) levels compared with baseline. The combination enalapril/lercanidipine improved it more than the single therapies. All treatments increased sRAGE levels, and decreased sCD40L and MPO, with a better effect seen with the enalapril/lercanidipine combination compared with single monotherapies.The combination enalapril/lercanidipine seems to be better than the single monotherapies in reducing not only blood pressure, but also the levels of some emerging biomarkers, potentially useful for cardiovascular risk stratification of hypertensive patients.The effect of losartan versus atenolol on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with hypertension taking aspirin: the Losartan Intervention for Endpoint Reduction in hypertension (LIFE) study.We conducted a subgroup analysis in the Losartan Intervention For Endpoint reduction in hypertension (LIFE) study to determine whether aspirin interacted with the properties of losartan, an angiotensin-II receptor antagonist.Negative interactions between angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and aspirin have been reported. There are no data reported from clinical trials about possible interactions between angiotensin-II receptor antagonists and aspirin.The LIFE study assigned 9,193 patients with hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) to losartan- or atenolol-based therapy for a mean of 4.7 years, with 1,970 (21.4%) taking aspirin at baseline. The primary composite end point (CEP) included cardiovascular death, stroke, and myocardial infarction (MI). The present cohort was stratified by aspirin use at baseline.Blood pressures were reduced similarly in the losartan with aspirin (n = 1,004) and atenolol with aspirin (n = 966) groups. The CEP was reduced by 32% (95% confidence interval 0.55 to 0.86, p = 0.001) with losartan with aspirin compared to atenolol with aspirin, adjusted for Framingham risk score and LVH. The test for treatment versus aspirin interaction, excluding other covariates, was significant for the CEP (p = 0.016) and MI (p = 0.037).There was a statistical interaction between treatment and aspirin in the LIFE study, with significantly greater reductions for the CEP and MI with losartan in patients using aspirin than in patients not using aspirin at baseline. Further studies are needed to clarify whether this represents a pharmacologic interaction or a selection by aspirin use of patients more likely to respond to losartan treatment.Effects of nisoldipine and lisinopril on left ventricular mass and function in diabetic nephropathy.To compare the effects of the calcium channel blocker, nisoldipine, and the ACE inhibitor, lisinopril, on left ventricular mass (LVM) and systolic function in type 1 diabetic patients with diabetic nephropathy.M-mode echocardiography was performed in 50 hypertensive type 1 diabetic patients with diabetic nephropathy enrolled in a 1-year, randomized, double-blind, parallel study of antihypertensive treatment with nisoldipine CC (20-40 mg/day) or lisinopril (10-20 mg/day). Ambulatory 24-h blood pressure was measured with the Takeda TM 2420 device (A & D, Tokyo, Japan) every 3 months. Three patients dropped out and seven patients were excluded due to technical difficulties.The 24-h diastolic blood pressure was reduced from 83 to 80 mmHg in the nisoldipine group (P = 0.06) and from 85 to 80 mmHg in the lisinopril group (P = 0.02). The decline in systolic blood pressure was not significant with any of the two treatments, and no difference in reduction of blood pressure was seen between groups. LVM corrected for body surface area (LVMI) was comparable between groups at baseline and increased from 96 +/- 5 to 107 +/- 6 g/m2 (mean +/- SEM; P = 0.007) in the nisoldipine group and from 95 +/- 4 to 103 +/- 5 g/m2 (P = 0.03) in the lisinopril group. The mean difference between the change in LVMI in the two groups was 2.9 (95% CI 6.8 to 12.7) g/m2. The prevalence of left ventricular hypertrophy rose from 18 (95% CI 6-30) to 30% (16-44) during the study period. A multiple linear regression analysis revealed that after 1 year of treatment, LVMI increased with higher systolic blood pressure level and declining glomerular filtration rate (R2 = 0.25). Fractional shortening was within normal range at baseline, 42 +/- 1 vs. 41 +/- 1% with nisoldipine and lisinopril, respectively, and did not change during follow-up.Antihypertensive treatment with nisoldipine or lisinopril to bring diastolic blood pressure level within the normal target range does not hinder a rise in LVMI in type 1 diabetic patients with diabetic nephropathy.One-year renal and cardiac effects of bisoprolol versus losartan in recently diagnosed hypertensive patients: a randomized, double-blind study.Hypertension is a significant cause of chronic renal injury and its effective treatment is capable of reducing the rate of renal failure. beta-Adrenoceptor antagonists (beta-blockers) have been reported to induce a deterioration in renal function, while several data have indicated a renoprotective effect of treatment with the angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist losartan. Previous studies of the interaction between the selective beta(1)-blocker bisoprolol and kidney function were performed only for short- and medium-term periods. The aim of this study was to compare the antihypertensive efficacy and renal and cardiac haemodynamic effects of bisoprolol with those of losartan over a 1-year time period in patients with essential hypertension.Seventy-two patients (40 males) with recently diagnosed uncomplicated (European Society of Hypertension [ESH] criteria stage 1-2) hypertension (mean +/- SD age 52 +/- 12 years) were enrolled in the study. After a run-in period of 14 days on placebo, the patients were randomized in a double-blind, prospective study to receive either bisoprolol 5 mg or losartan 50 mg, administered once daily for 1 year. At recruitment and 12 months after treatment, cardiac output and renal haemodynamics and function were evaluated by echocardiography and radionuclide studies, respectively.There were no significant differences in baseline clinical data, including glomerular filtration rate and blood pressure, between the two treatment groups. At 1 year, blood pressure had decreased significantly (p < 0.001) with both treatments, and heart rate was reduced only in the group taking bisoprolol. The long-term effects on renal haemodynamics and cardiac function were similar with both drugs, the only change being a significant reduction in the filtration fraction for each group.These data suggest that both bisoprolol and losartan are effective agents for the treatment of patients with recently diagnosed ESH stage 1-2 hypertension. Over a 1-year period, both agents maintained good renal and cardiac performance and haemodynamics.Cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in hypertensive patients with lower versus higher risk: a LIFE substudy.We hypothesized that losartan was superior to atenolol in reducing cardiovascular events in a lower-risk group (LRG) versus a higher-risk group (HRG) of patients in a Losartan Intervention For Endpoint reduction (LIFE) substudy, independently of blood pressure (BP) reduction. In a post hoc analysis, we designated 4282 patients as LRG on the basis of: (1) no previous cardiovascular disease (coronary, cerebral, peripheral vascular disease); (2) no diabetes; (3) no isolated systolic hypertension; and (4) inclusion of the lowest 3 quartiles of electrocardiographically documented left ventricular hypertrophy. The HRG consisted of 4911 remaining patients who did not qualify for the LRG. In the LRG, losartan was superior to atenolol in reducing stroke: hazard ratio (HR), 0.72 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.53 to 0.98); new-onset diabetes (HR, 0.74 [95% CI, 0.58 to 0.93]; and new-onset atrial fibrillation: HR, 0.69 (95% CI, 0.51 to 0.92), all P<0.05 but not composite end points or cardiovascular mortality (both P=NS). In the HRG, losartan was superior to atenolol in reducing composite end points: HR, 0.82 (95% CI, 0.71 to 0.94), P<0.01; cardiovascular mortality: HR, 0.77 (95% CI, 0.62 to 0.95), P<0.05; stroke: HR, 0.75 (95% CI, 0.61 to 0.92), P<0.01; new-onset diabetes: HR, 0.76 (95% CI, 0.60 to 0.96), P<0.05; and new-onset atrial fibrillation: HR, 0.71 (95% CI, 0.58 to 88), P<0.05. Test for interaction of treatment with LRG versus HRG was not significant for composite end point, stroke, or atrial fibrillation, but was for cardiovascular mortality (P=0.018). Achieved systolic BP reduction favored losartan over atenolol by -1.8 mm Hg in LRG (P=NS) and -0.7 mm Hg (P=0.001) in HRG, but no significant differences occurred in diastolic or mean BP in either group. In conclusion, losartan compared with atenolol reduces the risk of stroke, new-onset diabetes, and new-onset atrial fibrillation in the LRG and the HRG.Long-term renal preservation in essential hypertension. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition is superior to beta-blockade.Antihypertensive treatment is known to slow down the decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) with time. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition has been shown to be more effective in this regard than conventional antihypertensive therapy. In a recent prospective, randomized, double blind trial in 257 patients with essential hypertension, the loss of GFR, determined with 51Cr-EDTA clearance, was significantly less with an ACE inhibitor (cilazapril) than with a beta-adrenoceptor blocker (atenolol) during the first year of treatment. However, after 2 years, the two therapies were equally effective in this regard, thereby creating doubts about the long-term superiority of ACE inhibition in this regard. In order to elucidate whether the superior renal preservation with the ACE inhibitor was a transient effect, GFR was measured after 1 more year of treatment, i.e., after 36 months. At that time, the decline in GFR was significantly smaller in the ACE inhibitor group as compared to the beta-adrenoceptor blocker group (-3.0 [-5.5, -1.0; 95% CI] v -7.0 [-9.0, -4.5; 95% CI] mL/min x 1.73 m2; P = .026). This demonstrates that in the treatment of essential hypertension ACE inhibition preserves GFR significantly better than beta-adrenoceptor blockade during long-term therapy.Pharmacogenetic association of the NPPA T2238C genetic variant with cardiovascular disease outcomes in patients with hypertension.The NPPA gene codes for the precursor of atrial natriuretic polypeptide, suggesting that NPPA may modulate the efficacy of some antihypertensive drugs.To test whether participants with minor NPPA alleles in the T2238C or G664A variants had different rates of cardiovascular disease or blood pressure (BP) changes than common allele homozygotes when treated with a diuretic vs other antihypertensive medications.Post hoc analysis of 38,462 participants with hypertension from ALLHAT, a multicenter randomized clinical trial conducted in the United States and Canada. Genotyping was performed from February 2004 to January 2005.Participants were randomly assigned to receive a diuretic (chlorthalidone; n = 13,860), a calcium antagonist (amlodipine; n = 8174), an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (lisinopril; n = 8233), or an alpha-blocker (doxazosin; n = 8195).The primary outcome measure was coronary heart disease (CHD), defined as fatal CHD or nonfatal myocardial infarction (mean follow-up, 4.9 years). Secondary outcomes were stroke, all-cause mortality, combined cardiovascular disease outcomes, and 6-month systolic and diastolic BP changes. Genotype x treatment interactions were tested where genotypes were modeled additively and dominantly.Depending on genotype, the event rates per 1000 person-years were 15.3 to 19.7 for CHO, 9.6 to 15.4 for stroke, and 27.4 to 30.7 for all-cause mortality. For the NPPA T2238C variant, lower event rates were found for the C allele carriers than for the TT homozygous individuals when comparing chlorthalidone and amlodipine (CHD: CC = 0.86; TC = 0.90; TT = 1.09; P = .03 [dominant model]; stroke: CC = 1.18; TC = 0.82; TT = 1.26; P = .01 [additive and dominant models]; all-cause mortality: CC = 0.87; TC = 0.98; TT = 1.12; P = .05 [dominant model]). Combined end points yielded similar results. Consistent with these clinical findings, 6-month changes in systolic BP for those with the CC genotype showed larger reductions with chlorthalidone (-6.5 mm Hg) than with amlodipine (-3.8 mm Hg), lisinopril (-2.4 mm Hg), or doxazosin (-3.8 mm Hg). Among those with the TT genotype, systolic BP differences between drugs were less (range, -5.4 to -7.5 mm Hg; P value, <.001 to .003 for interaction); diastolic BP showed similar results. We found no pharmacogenetic associations with the NPPA G664A variant.The NPPA T2238C variant was associated with modification of antihypertensive medication effects on cardiovascular disease and BP. Minor C allele carriers experienced more favorable cardiovascular disease outcomes when randomized to receive a diuretic, whereas TT allele carriers had more favorable outcomes when randomized to receive a calcium channel blocker.The Valsartan Antihypertensive Long-Term Use Evaluation (VALUE) trial: outcomes in patients receiving monotherapy.In the main Valsartan Antihypertensive Long-Term Use Evaluation (VALUE) report, we investigated outcomes in 15 245 high-risk hypertensive subjects treated with valsartan- or amlodipine-based regimens. In this report, we analyzed outcomes in 7080 patients (46.4%) who, at the end of the initial drug adjustment period (6 months), remained on monotherapy. Baseline characteristics were similar in the valsartan (N=3263) and amlodipine (N=3817) groups. Time on monotherapy was 3.2 years (78% of treatment exposure time). The average in-trial blood pressure was similar in both groups. Event rates in the monotherapy group were 16% to 39% lower than in the main VALUE trial. In the first analysis, we censored patients when they discontinued monotherapy ("censored"); in the second, we counted events regardless of subsequent therapy (intention-to-treat principle). We also assessed the impact of duration of monotherapy on outcomes. No difference was found in primary composite cardiac end points, strokes, myocardial infarctions, and all-cause deaths with both analyses. Heart failure in the valsartan group was lower both in the censored and intention-to-treat analyses (hazard ratios: 0.63, P=0.004 and 0.78, P=0.045, respectively). Longer duration of monotherapy amplified between-group differences in heart failure. New-onset diabetes was lower in the valsartan group with both analyses (odds ratios: 0.78, P=0.012 and 0.82, P=0.034). Thus, despite lower absolute event rates in monotherapy patients, the relative risks of heart failure and new-onset diabetes favored valsartan. Moreover, these findings support the feasibility of comparative prospective trials in lower-risk hypertensive patients.Outcomes in subgroups of hypertensive patients treated with regimens based on valsartan and amlodipine: An analysis of findings from the VALUE trial.In the Valsartan Antihypertensive Long-term Use Evaluation (VALUE) trial the primary outcome (cardiac morbidity and mortality) did not differ between valsartan and amlodipine-based treatment groups, although systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure reductions were significantly more pronounced with amlodipine. Stroke incidence was non-significantly, and myocardial infarction was significantly lower in the amlodipine-based regimen, whereas cardiac failure was non-significantly lower on valsartan.The study protocol specified additional analyses of the primary endpoint according to: sex; age; race; geographical region; smoking status; type 2 diabetes; total cholesterol; left ventricular hypertrophy; proteinuria; serum creatinine; a history of coronary heart disease; a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack; and a history of peripheral artery disease. Additional subgroups were isolated systolic hypertension and classes of antihypertensive agents used immediately before randomization.The 15,245 hypertensive patients participating in VALUE were divided into subgroups according to baseline characteristics. Treatment by subgroup interaction analyses were carried out by a Cox proportional hazard model. Within each subgroup, treatment effects were assessed by hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals.For cardiac mortality and morbidity, the only significant subgroup by treatment interaction was of sex (P = 0.016), with the hazard ratio indicating a relative excess of cardiac events with valsartan treatment in women but not in men, but SBP differences in favour of amlodipine were distinctly greater in women. No other subgroup showed a significant difference in the composite cardiac outcome between valsartan and amlodipine-based treatments. For secondary endpoints, a sex-related significant interaction was found for heart failure (P < 0.0001), with men but not women having a lower incidence of heart failure with valsartan.As in the whole VALUE cohort, in no subgroup of patients were there differences in the incidence of the composite cardiac endpoint with valsartan and amlodipine-based treatments, despite a greater blood pressure decrease in the amlodipine group. The only exception was sex, in which the amlodipine-based regimen was more effective than valsartan in women, but not in men, whereas the valsartan regimen was more effective in preventing cardiac failure in men than in women.Baseline characteristics of the diabetic participants in the Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT).Hypertension (HTN) is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) in the setting of diabetes. There is no consensus on how best to treat hypertension among those with diabetes. Here we describe the characteristics of a cohort of hypertensive adults with diabetes who are part of a large prospective blood pressure study. This study will help clarify the treatment of HTN in the setting of diabetes.The Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering high-risk hypertensive participants, ages > or = 55 years, designed to determine whether the incidence of fatal and nonfatal coronary heart disease (CHD) and combined cardiovascular events (fatal and nonfatal CHD, revascularization surgery, angina pectoris, congestive heart failure, and stroke) differs between diuretic (chlorthalidone) treatment and three alternative antihypertensive therapies: a calcium channel blocker (amlodipine), an ACE inhibitor (lisinopril), and an alpha-adrenergic blocker (doxazosin). The planned follow-up is an average of 6 years, to be completed March 2002.There are 15,297 diabetic individuals in the ALLHAT study (36.0% of the entire cohort). Of these individuals, 50.2% are male, 39.4% are African-American, and 17.7% are Hispanic. Demographic and laboratory characteristics of the cohort are similar to those of other studies of the U.S. elderly population with HTN. The sample size has 42 and 93% confidence, treatments for the two study outcomes.The diabetic cohort in ALLHAT wil be able to provide valuable information about the treatment of hypertension in older diabetic patients at risk for incident CVD.Renoprotective effect of the angiotensin-receptor antagonist irbesartan in patients with nephropathy due to type 2 diabetes.It is unknown whether either the angiotensin-II-receptor blocker irbesartan or the calcium-channel blocker amlodipine slows the progression of nephropathy in patients with type 2 diabetes independently of its capacity to lower the systemic blood pressure.We randomly assigned 1715 hypertensive patients with nephropathy due to type 2 diabetes to treatment with irbesartan (300 mg daily), amlodipine (10 mg daily), or placebo. The target blood pressure was 135/85 mm Hg or less in all groups. We compared the groups with regard to the time to the primary composite end point of a doubling of the base-line serum creatinine concentration, the development of end-stage renal disease, or death from any cause. We also compared them with regard to the time to a secondary, cardiovascular composite end point.The mean duration of follow-up was 2.6 years. Treatment with irbesartan was associated with a risk of the primary composite end point that was 20 percent lower than that in the placebo group (P=0.02) and 23 percent lower than that in the amlodipine group (P=0.006). The risk of a doubling of the serum creatinine concentration was 33 percent lower in the irbesartan group than in the placebo group (P=0.003) and 37 percent lower in the irbesartan group than in the amlodipine group (P<0.001). Treatment with irbesartan was associated with a relative risk of end-stage renal disease that was 23 percent lower than that in both other groups (P=0.07 for both comparisons). These differences were not explained by differences in the blood pressures that were achieved. The serum creatinine concentration increased 24 percent more slowly in the irbesartan group than in the placebo group (P=0.008) and 21 percent more slowly than in the amlodipine group (P=0.02). There were no significant differences in the rates of death from any cause or in the cardiovascular composite end point.The angiotensin-II-receptor blocker irbesartan is effective in protecting against the progression of nephropathy due to type 2 diabetes. This protection is independent of the reduction in blood pressure it causes.Long-term effects of irbesartan and atenolol on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system in human primary hypertension: the Swedish Irbesartan Left Ventricular Hypertrophy Investigation versus Atenolol (SILVHIA).We examined long-term influence of the angiotensin II type 1-receptor blocker irbesartan and the beta1-adrenergic receptor blocker atenolol on some neurohormonal systems implicated in the pathophysiology of cardiac hypertrophy. Thus, 115 hypertensive patients with left ventricular hypertrophy were randomized to receive double-blind irbesartan or atenolol, with additional therapy if needed. Neurohormone measurements and echocardiography were performed at weeks 0, 12, 24, and 48. Left ventricular mass was reduced more by irbesartan than by atenolol (-26 g/m2 versus -14 g/m2, P = 0.024), despite similar reductions in blood pressure. Plasma renin activity and angiotensin II increased (P < 0.001) by irbesartan (0.9 +/- 0.7 to 3.4 +/- 4.2 ng/mL x h, and 3.0 +/- 1.6 to 13.0 +/- 17.7 pmol/L), but decreased (P < 0.01) by atenolol (1.0 +/- 0.6 to 0.7 +/- 0.6 ng/mL x h, and 3.4 +/- 1.6 to 3.2 +/- 2.2 pmol/L). Serum aldosterone decreased (P < 0.05) by both irbesartan (346 +/- 140 to 325 +/- 87 pmol/L) and atenolol (315 +/- 115 to 283 +/- 77 pmol/L). Changes in left ventricular mass by irbesartan related inversely to changes in plasma renin activity, angiotensin II, and aldosterone (all P < 0.05). Plasma levels and 24-hour urinary excretions of catecholamines, plasma leptin, proinsulin, insulin and insulin sensitivity remained largely unchanged in both groups. Thus, the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system appears to be an important non-hemodynamic factor in the regulation of left ventricular mass.The relationship of electrocardiographic left ventricular hypertrophy to decreased serum potassium.Low serum potassium (K) is associated with increased blood pressure, impaired cardiac function and renal dysfunction. Although lower serum K is associated with cardiac hypertrophy in animal models, the relationship of low serum K to the presence and severity of electrocardiographic left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is unclear.Baseline and yearly Cornell product LVH levels were examined in relation to low serum K (serum K ≤ 3.90 mEq/l, the lowest quartile of baseline K levels) in 8586 patients with baseline K levels. Patients were randomized to losartan-vs atenolol-based treatment and additional hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) therapy as needed.After adjusting for age, sex, race, prior antihypertensive treatment, losartan vs atenolol therapy, HCTZ use, baseline diastolic and systolic pressure, body mass index, serum creatinine and urine albumin/creatinine ratio, baseline serum K ≤ 3.90 was associated with significantly higher mean baseline Cornell product LVH (2898 vs 2801 mm•ms, p = 0.001) and a 24% higher risk of Cornell product LVH > 2440 mm•ms at baseline (OR 1.24, 95% CI 1.11-1.38, p < 0.001). After also adjusting for baseline Cornell product and changes in diastolic and systolic pressure between baseline and each year of measurement, in-treatment serum K ≤ 3.90 determined yearly was associated with significantly higher mean Cornell product LVH at years 1-3 and with statistically significant 16-32% increased risks of LVH by Cornell product at years 1-4.A low serum K is independently associated with a greater likelihood and severity of Cornell product LVH during antihypertensive therapy.Cardiovascular risk reduction in hypertensive black patients with left ventricular hypertrophy: the LIFE study.We report on a subanalysis of the effects of losartan and atenolol on cardiovascular events in black patients in the Losartan Intervention For Endpoint reduction in hypertension (LIFE) study.The LIFE study compared losartan-based to atenolol-based therapy in 9,193 hypertensive patients with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). Overall, the risk of the primary composite end point (cardiovascular death, stroke, myocardial infarction) was reduced by 13% (p = 0.021) with losartan, with similar blood pressure (BP) reduction in both treatment groups. There was a suggestion of interaction between ethnic background and treatment (p = 0.057).Exploratory analyses were performed that placed LIFE study patients into black (n = 533) and non-black (n = 8,660) categories, overall, and in the U.S. (African American [n = 523]; non-black [n = 1,184]).A significant interaction existed between the dichotomized groups (black/non-black) and treatment (p = 0.005); a test for qualitative interaction was also significant (p = 0.016). The hazard ratio (losartan relative to atenolol) for the primary end point favored atenolol in black patients (1.666 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.043 to 2.661]; p = 0.033) and favored losartan in non-blacks (0.829 [95% CI 0.733 to 0.938]; p = 0.003). In black patients, BP reduction was similar in both groups, and regression of electrocardiographic-LVH was greater with losartan.Results of the subanalysis are sufficient to generate the hypothesis that black patients with hypertension and LVH might not respond as favorably to losartan-based treatment as non-black patients with respect to cardiovascular outcomes, and do not support a recommendation for losartan as a first-line treatment for this purpose. The subanalysis is limited by the relatively small number of events.Effect of blood pressure lowering and antihypertensive drug class on progression of hypertensive kidney disease: results from the AASK trial.Hypertension is a leading cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in the United States, with no known treatment to prevent progressive declines leading to ESRD.To compare the effects of 2 levels of blood pressure (BP) control and 3 antihypertensive drug classes on glomerular filtration rate (GFR) decline in hypertension.Randomized 3 x 2 factorial trial with enrollment from February 1995 to September 1998.A total of 1094 African Americans aged 18 to 70 years with hypertensive renal disease (GFR, 20-65 mL/min per 1.73 m(2)) were recruited from 21 clinical centers throughout the United States and followed up for 3 to 6.4 years.Participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 mean arterial pressure goals, 102 to 107 mm Hg (usual; n = 554) or 92 mm Hg or less (lower; n = 540), and to initial treatment with either a beta-blocker (metoprolol 50-200 mg/d; n = 441), an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ramipril 2.5-10 mg/d; n = 436) or a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker, (amlodipine 5-10 mg/d; n = 217). Open-label agents were added to achieve the assigned BP goals.Rate of change in GFR (GFR slope); clinical composite outcome of reduction in GFR by 50% or more (or > or =25 mL/min per 1.73 m2) from baseline, ESRD, or death. Three primary treatment comparisons were specified: lower vs usual BP goal; ramipril vs metoprolol; and amlodipine vs metoprolol.Achieved BP averaged (SD) 128/78 (12/8) mm Hg in the lower BP group and 141/85 (12/7) mm Hg in the usual BP group. The mean (SE) GFR slope from baseline through 4 years did not differ significantly between the lower BP group (-2.21 [0.17] mL/min per 1.73 m2 per year) and the usual BP group (-1.95 [0.17] mL/min per 1.73 m2 per year; P =.24), and the lower BP goal did not significantly reduce the rate of the clinical composite outcome (risk reduction for lower BP group = 2%; 95% confidence interval [CI], -22% to 21%; P =.85). None of the drug group comparisons showed consistent significant differences in the GFR slope. However, compared with the metoprolol and amlodipine groups, the ramipril group manifested risk reductions in the clinical composite outcome of 22% (95% CI, 1%-38%; P =.04) and 38% (95% CI, 14%-56%; P =.004), respectively. There was no significant difference in the clinical composite outcome between the amlodipine and metoprolol groups.No additional benefit of slowing progression of hypertensive nephrosclerosis was observed with the lower BP goal. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors appear to be more effective than beta-blockers or dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers in slowing GFR decline.Characteristics of 9194 patients with left ventricular hypertrophy: the LIFE study. Losartan Intervention For Endpoint Reduction in Hypertension.-Losartan was the first available orally administered selective antagonist of the angiotensin II type 1 receptor developed for the treatment of hypertension. The Losartan Intervention For Endpoint (LIFE) Reduction in Hypertension Study is a double-blind, prospective, parallel group study designed to compare the effects of losartan with those of the beta-blocker atenolol on the reduction of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Patients with essential hypertension, aged between 55 and 80 years, and ECG-documented left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) were included. Altogether, 9223 patients in Scandinavia, the United Kingdom, and the United States were randomized from June 1995 through April 1997, and 9194 remain after exclusion of a study center at which irregularities were discovered. This population of hypertensives (mean systolic/diastolic blood pressure, 174.4/97.8 mm Hg) with LVH comprises women (54.1%) and men, mostly retired from active work (mean age, 66.9 years), with a high prevalence of overweight (mean body mass index, 28.0 kg/m2), diabetes mellitus (12.3%), lipid disorders (18.0%), and symptoms or signs of coronary heart disease (15.1%). There were fewer current smokers (<17%) than in the general population, and approximately 7% were nonwhite. Almost 30% of participants had been untreated for at least 6 months when screened for the study. Only 1557 persons who entered the placebo run-in period of 14 days were excluded, predominantly because of sitting blood pressures above or below the predetermined range of 160-200/95-115 mm Hg and ECG-LVH criteria not met. By application of simple 12-lead ECG criteria for LVH (Cornell voltage QRS duration product formula plus Sokolow-Lyon voltage read by a core laboratory), hypertensive patients with LVH with an average 5-year coronary heart disease risk of 22.3% according to the Framingham score were identified. This population is now being treated (goal, <140/90 mm Hg) in adherence with the protocol for at least 4 years after final enrollment (ie, through April 2001) and until at least 1040 patients suffer myocardial infarction, stroke, or cardiovascular death.Irbesartan reduces common carotid artery intima-media thickness in hypertensive patients when compared with atenolol: the Swedish Irbesartan Left Ventricular Hypertrophy Investigation versus Atenolol (SILVHIA) study.Angiotensin II promotes cell growth and has been implicated in the development and maintenance of left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy and of structural vascular changes. We wished to examine whether an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) would influence structural vascular changes beyond the effects of blood pressure reduction.Hypertensive patients with LV hypertrophy (age 55 +/- 9 years, blood pressure 162 +/- 19/104 +/- 8 mmHg, LV mass index 148 +/- 31 g m(-2); mean +/- SD) were randomized double-blind to the ARB irbesartan (n=52) or the beta(1) receptor blocker atenolol (n=56) for 48 weeks. Ultrasonography of the left and right common carotid artery (CCA) and echocardiography were performed at week 0 and 48.With similar reductions in blood pressure, CCA intima-media thickness (IMT) was reduced by irbesartan (from 0.92 +/- 0.14 by 0.01 +/- 0.10 mm, NS), whereas it was increased by atenolol (from 0.94 +/- 0.21 by 0.03 +/- 0.12 mm, P=0.018; P=0.002 between groups). CCA lumen diameter was less reduced by irbesartan than by atenolol. Thus, CCA intima-media area was reduced by irbesartan (from 21.3 +/- 5.0 by 0.90 +/- 2.45 mm(2), P=0.034) but not by atenolol (from 21.3 +/- 6.1 by 0.18 +/- 2.71 mm(2), NS; P=0.037 between groups). Changes in CCA IMT or area did not relate to changes in LV mass.The favourable effects by irbesartan on CCA IMT with an outward vascular remodelling suggest that angiotensin II mediates structural vascular changes, beyond the effects of blood pressure. This may be important in the prevention of cerebrovascular events.The effects of losartan compared to atenolol on stroke in patients with isolated systolic hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy. The LIFE study.The Losartan Intervention For Endpoint reduction in hypertension (LIFE) study reported that a losartan-based antihypertensive regimen reduced cardiovascular morbidity and mortality (composite of cardiovascular death, stroke, and myocardial infarction) more than therapy based on atenolol in patients with left ventricular hypertrophy and isolated systolic hypertension (ISH). Patients aged 55-80 years with blood pressures 160-200/<90 mm Hg were followed for a mean of 4.7 years. Blood pressure was similarly reduced in the losartan (n=660) and atenolol (n=666) ISH groups. There were 88 (6.6%) patients who experienced a stroke, 18 of which were fatal. Of patients experiencing strokes, 72.7% had an ischemic stroke. ISH patients in LIFE compared to the non-ISH group had a higher incidence of any stroke and embolic stroke, and similar incidences of fatal, atherosclerotic, and hemorrhagic/other strokes. The incidence of any stroke (40% risk reduction [RR], p=0.02), fatal stroke (70% RR, p=0.035), and atherothrombotic stroke (45% RR, p=0.022) was significantly lower in losartan-treated compared to the atenolol-treated patients. The 36% RR for embolic strokes in the losartan group was not statistically significantly (p=0.33) different from the atenolol group. These data suggest that losartan-based treatment is more effective than an atenolol-based treatment for patients with ISH and a high risk for stroke.The effects of amlodipine and enalapril on renal function in adults with hypertension and nondiabetic nephropathies: a 3-year, randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.Placebo-controlled trials have found that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) decrease proteinuria and slow the progression of nondiabetic nephropathies. However, head-to-head comparisons of ACEIs and calcium channel blockers (CCBs) have shown conflicting results. Indeed, a recent metaanalysis concluded that there is still uncertainty about the greater renoprotection seen with ACEIs or angiotensin II receptor blockers in nondiabetic patients with renal disease, particularly when using true glomerular filtration rate (GFR) as the primary outcome.The objective of this 3-year, randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was to compare true GFR decline (measured by yearly 51Cr-EDTA blood clearance) in nondiabetic, nonnephrotic adult hypertensive patients with estimated creatinine clearance of 20 to 60 mL/min.1.73 m(2), when randomized to a CCB (amlodipine, 5-10 mg/d) or an ACEI (enalapril, 5-20 mg/d).Patients (aged 18-80 years) entered a 4-week placebo run-in washout period and previous antihypertensive drugs were tapered off over 2 weeks. Add-on treatments were atenolol (50-100 mg/d), loop diuretics (furosemide, 20-500 mg/d or torsemide, 5-200 mg/d), alpha-blockers (prazosin, 2.5-5 mg/d or doxazosin, 1-16 mg/d), and centrally acting drugs (rilmenidine, 1-2 mg/d or methyldopa, 250-500 mg/d). The primary end point was true GFR measured by yearly (51)Cr-EDTA blood clearance. Secondary end points included a clinical composite of renal events and tolerability collected by a full clinical and laboratory evaluation at each study visit. Post hoc analyses for the change in GFR, proteinuria, and time to clinical events were also planned on baseline proteinuria subgroups (<1 and >or=1 g/d) before unblinding the database.Three hundred eighteen patients entered the run-in period and 263 patients (156 men/107 women; mean age, 58 years) were randomized to receive either amlodipine (5 mg/d, n=132) or enalapril (5 mg/d, n=131). Blood pressure declined from 165/102 mm Hg to 138/84 mm Hg and 138/85 mm Hg with amlodipine and enalapril, respectively (no between-group significance). Only 20.8% of the patients randomized to ACEI treatment received diuretics at the last observation. No statistically significant difference was found between amlodipine and enalapril in GFR decline (-4.92 and -3.98 mL/min.1.73 m(2), respectively, at last observation) and composite secondary end point after a median follow-up of 2.9 years, including in the subgroup of patients with proteinuria >1 g/d at baseline. Protein excretion rate decreased significantly from baseline in patients taking enalapril plus diuretics (median -270 mg/d; P<0.001) but not in patients taking amlodipine plus diuretics (-25 mg/d at last observation).In this cohort of nondiabetic, nonnephrotic hypertensive patients, no statistically significant difference in true GFR decline was found over 3 years between amlodipine-treated patients and enalapril-treated patients with main add-on treatment with ss-blockers, including in the subgroup of patients with proteinuria >1 g/d.Effects of losartan and atenolol on left ventricular mass and neurohormonal profile in patients with essential hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy.To compare the effects of the angiotensin II antagonist, losartan, with those of atenolol on left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), blood pressure and neurohormone concentrations in hypertensive patients with LVH.A multinational, randomized, double-blind trial.Hospital.Hypertensive patients with an echocardiographically documented left ventricular mass index (LVMI) 120 g/m(2) (men) or 105 g/m(2) (women).Patients allocated randomly to groups received either losartan or atenolol 50 mg/day for 36 weeks, with possible titration to 100 mg/day, and addition of hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 or 25 mg/day.Changes in LVMI and sitting systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressures after 36 weeks of treatment (study powered for non-inferiority hypothesis). All echocardiographic data were read in a central laboratory by staff blinded to the treatments and sequence of echocardiographic tapes.The estimated treatment difference between the losartan and atenolol regimens (mean change from baseline at week 36) in LVMI was -2.5 g/m(2) [95% confidence interval (CI) -7.36 to 2.37 g/m(2) ] in favor of losartan, indicating that losartan was significantly non-inferior ( 0.001, non-inferiority limit 8 g/m(2) ) and numerically superior to atenolol in reducing LVMI. The losartan-based regimen significantly reduced LVMI after 36 weeks compared with baseline (-6.56 g/m(2) , 95% CI -10.24 to -2.88 g/m(2) , P<0.001), whereas the atenolol-based regimen had no significant effect (-3.71 g/m, 95% CI -7.75 to 0.32 g/m(2) , P= NS). In a subset of 82 patients, significant changes in serum concentrations of atrial natriuretic peptide, brain natriuretic peptide and immunoreactive amino-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide were recorded in losartan-treated ( 0.01) but not atenolol-treated patients. Losartan and atenolol significantly decreased SBP and DBP from baseline after 6, 12, 24 and 36 weeks. The changes from baseline in DBP were greater in the atenolol group at weeks 6 and 36 [difference -2.6 mmHg ( P= 0.016) at week 36]. However, both treatment regimens achieved similar SBP/DBP values at week 36 (141.1 +/- 12.8/86.8 +/- 8.2 mmHg for losartan and 141.4 +/- 17.2/85.0 +/- 10.1 mmHg for atenolol, respectively). Overall, losartan treatment was associated with significantly fewer drug-related clinical adverse events, compared with atenolol (10 and 22%, respectively, P= 0.028).Both losartan- and atenolol-based regimens effectively decreased blood pressure. Losartan was non-inferior and numerically superior to atenolol in regression of LVH. The reduction in hypertrophy with losartan treatment was accompanied by reductions in circulating concentrations of cardiac natriuretic peptides. Losartan, by specifically blocking angiotensin II, may therefore have effects on the heart beyond those expected from the decrease in blood pressure alone. Losartan was better tolerated than atenolol.Comparison of the effects of telmisartan and nifedipine gastrointestinal therapeutic system on blood pressure control, glucose metabolism, and the lipid profile in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and mild hypertension: a 12-month, randomized, double-blind study.Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) provide effective blood pressure control. Whereas none of the ARBs appear to affect glucose homeostasis, some ARBs have been associated with a decrease in cholesterolemia.This study was conducted to evaluate blood pressure control glucose homeostasis, and the plasma lipid profile in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and mild hypertension during 12 months of treatment with the ARB telmisartan or nifedipine gastrointestinal therapeutic system (GITS).In this double-blind trial, patients taking oral hypoglycemic agents were randomized to receive telmisartan 40 mg or nifedipine GITS 20 mg once daily for 12 months. At the time of enrollment, patients were given advice on diet (1400-1600 kcal/d) and exercise (stationary bicycle for > or =30 min, 4 d/wk). Assessments of systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure, body mass index (BMI), fasting plasma glucose concentrations, glycosylated hemoglobin, fasting plasma insulin concentrations, the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance, and the lipid profile were performed at baseline and after 6 and 12 months of treatment.One hundred sixteen patients were divided into 2 age- and sex-matched treatment groups (58 men, 58 women; mean [SD] age, 52.5 [5] years). All patients were in good general health at baseline; had achieved adequate glycemic control with diet and oral hypoglycemic agents; were taking antihypercholesterolemic drugs; and had no evidence of macroangiopathy, microalbuminuria, or neuropathy. There were significant reductions from baseline in seated trough SBP after 12 months of treatment with both telmisartan and nifedipine GITS (from 139 [4] to 132 [4] mm Hg and from 140 [4] to 130 [4] mm Hg, respectively; both, P < 0.01). No change in BMI or glucose metabolism was observed with either treatment. After 12 months, there were significant improvements in concentrations of total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) with telmisartan (-9% and -11.5%, respectively; both, P < 0.01) compared with nifedipine GITS (-2% and -1.5%).In this selected sample of patients with type 2 diabetes and mild hypertension, both telmisartan and nifedipine GITS produced significant reductions in blood pressure. Telmisartan was associated with a slight but statistically significant improvement in plasma TC and LDL-C concentrations compared with nifedipine GITS.Cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with diabetes in the Losartan Intervention For Endpoint reduction in hypertension study (LIFE): a randomised trial against atenolol.The most suitable antihypertensive drug to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease in patients with hypertension and diabetes is unclear. In prespecified analyses, we compared the effects of losartan and atenolol on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in diabetic patients.As part of the LIFE study, in a double-masked, randomised, parallel-group trial, we assigned a group of 1195 patients with diabetes, hypertension, and signs of left-ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) on electrocardiograms losartan-based or atenolol-based treatment. Mean age of patients was 67 years (SD 7) and mean blood pressure 177/96 mm Hg (14/10) after placebo run-in. We followed up patients for at least 4 years (mean 4.7 years [1.1]). We used Cox regression analysis with baseline Framingham risk score and electrocardiogram-LVH as covariates to compare the effects of the drugs on the primary composite endpoint of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality (cardiovascular death, stroke, or myocardial infarction).Mean blood pressure fell to 146/79 mm Hg (17/11) in losartan patients and 148/79 mm Hg (19/11) in atenolol patients. The primary endpoint occurred in 103 patients assigned losartan (n=586) and 139 assigned atenolol (n=609); relative risk 0.76 (95% CI 0.58-.98), p=0.031. 38 and 61 patients in the losartan and atenolol groups, respectively, died from cardiovascular disease; 0.63 (0.42-0.95), p=0.028. Mortality from all causes was 63 and 104 in losartan and atenolol groups, respectively; 0.61 (0.45-0.84), p=0.002.Losartan was more effective than atenolol in reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality as well as mortality from all causes in patients with hypertension, diabetes, and LVH. Losartan seems to have benefits beyond blood pressure reduction.Treatment of Mild Hypertension Study. Final results. Treatment of Mild Hypertension Study Research Group.To compare six antihypertensive interventions for the treatment of mild hypertension.Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial.Four hypertension screening and treatment centers in the United States.Hypertensive men and women, aged 45 to 69 years, with diastolic blood pressure less than 100 mm Hg.Sustained nutritional-hygienic advice to all participants to reduce weight, dietary sodium intake, and alcohol intake, and increase physical activity. Participants were randomly allocated to take (1) placebo (n = 234); (2) chlorthalidone (n = 136); (3) acebutolol (n = 132); (4) doxazosin mesylate (n = 134); (5) amlodipine maleate (n = 131); or (6) enalapril maleate (n = 135).Blood pressure, quality of life, side effects, blood lipid levels and analysis of other serum components, echocardiographic and electrocardiographic changes, and incidence of cardiovascular events over an average of 4.4 years of follow-up.Blood pressure reductions were sizable in all six groups, and were significantly greater for participants assigned to drug treatment than placebo (-15.9 vs -9.1 mm Hg for systolic blood pressure and -12.3 vs -8.6 mm Hg for diastolic blood pressure; P < .0001). After 4 years, 59% of participants assigned to placebo and 72% of participants given drug treatment continued on their initial medication as monotherapy. A smaller percentage of participants assigned to the drug-treatment groups died or experienced a major nonfatal cardiovascular event than those assigned to the placebo group (5.1% vs 7.3%; P = .21). After including other clinical events, the percentage of participants affected was 11.1% for those in the drug-treatment groups and 16.2% for those in the placebo group (P = .03). Incidence rates of most resting electrocardiographic abnormalities were lower and quality of life was improved more for those assigned to drug-treatment groups rather than the placebo group. Differences among the five drug treatments did not consistently favor one group in terms of regression of left ventricular mass, blood lipid levels, and other outcome measures.As an initial regimen, drug treatment in combination with nutritional-hygienic intervention was more effective in preventing cardiovascular and other clinical events than was nutritional-hygienic treatment alone. Drug-treatment group differences were minimal. Pending results from large-scale clinical trials to evaluate drug treatments for their effect on cardiovascular clinical events, these findings support the recommendations of the new fifth Joint National Committee report regarding treatment choices for people with stage 1 ("mild") hypertension.The Losartan Intervention For Endpoint reduction (LIFE) in Hypertension study: rationale, design, and methods. The LIFE Study Group.The treatment of hypertension mainly with diuretics and beta blockers reduces cardiovascular mortality and morbidity, largely due to a decreased incidence of stroke, whereas the beneficial effects of antihypertensive therapy on the occurrence of coronary events have been less than expected from epidemiological studies. Furthermore, treated hypertensive patients still have a higher cardiovascular complication rate, compared with matched normotensives. This is particularly evident in patients with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), a major independent risk indicator for cardiovascular disease. In addition to elevating blood pressure, angiotensin II (A-II) exerts an important influence on cardiac structure and function, stimulating cell proliferation and growth. Thus, to further reduce morbidity and mortality when treating hypertensive patients, it may be important to effectively block the effects of A-II. This can be achieved directly at the A-II receptor level by losartan, the first of a new class of antihypertensive agents. It therefore seems pertinent to investigate whether selective A-II receptor blockade with losartan not only lowers blood pressure but also reduces LVH more effectively than current therapy, and thus improves prognosis. The Losartan Intervention For Endpoint reduction (LIFE) in Hypertension study is a double-blind, prospective, parallel group study designed to compare the effects of losartan with those of the beta-blocker atenolol on the reduction of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in approximately 8,300 hypertensive patients (initial sitting diastolic blood pressure 95 to 115 mm Hg or systolic blood pressure 160 to 200 mm Hg) with electrocardiographically documented LVH. The study, which will continue for at least 4 years and until 1,040 patients experience one primary endpoint, has been designed with a statistical power that will detect a difference of at least 15% between groups in the incidence of combined cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. It is also the first prospective study with adequate power to link reversal of LVH to reduction in major cardiovascular events. The rationale of the study, which will involve more than 800 clinical centers in Scandinavia, the United Kingdom, and the United States, is discussed, and the major features of its design and general organization are described. On April 30, 1997, when inclusion was stopped, 9,218 patients had been randomized.Cardiovascular outcomes in the Irbesartan Diabetic Nephropathy Trial of patients with type 2 diabetes and overt nephropathy.Patients with diabetes have increased risk for adverse cardiovascular events. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are protective in type 1 diabetes. However, no definitive studies have examined the use of angiotensin-receptor blockers in patients with type 2 diabetes and overt nephropathy. The primary outcomes of the Irbesartan Diabetic Nephropathy Trial were doubling of serum creatinine levels, end-stage renal disease, and death from any cause.To compare rates of cardiovascular events among patients with type 2 diabetic nephropathy who received conventional antihypertensive therapy with an angiotensin-receptor blocker (irbesartan) or a calcium-channel blocker (amlodipine), or placebo.Randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with a median follow-up of 2.6 years. A time event analysis was used.209 centers in the Americas, Europe, Israel, and Australasia.1715 adults with type 2 diabetic nephropathy and hypertension; serum creatinine levels of 89 micromol/L (1.0 mg/dL) to 266 micromol/L (3.0 mg/dL) in women and 106 micromol/L (1.2 mg/dL) to 266 micromol/L (3.0 mg/dL) in men; and urinary protein excretion rates of at least 900 mg/d.Treatment with irbesartan, amlodipine, or placebo.Time to cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, strokes, and coronary revascularization.The three groups were not statistically different in the composite of cardiovascular events. Among the components of the composite, there was a trend toward a decrease in strokes in patients receiving amlodipine versus those receiving placebo (hazard ratio, 0.65 [95% CI, 0.35 to 1.22]; P = 0.18). Likewise, patients receiving amlodipine had a significantly lower rate of myocardial infarction when compared with placebo recipients (hazard ratio, 0.58 [CI, 0.37 to 0.92]; P = 0.02). In contrast, patients receiving irbesartan had a significantly lower incidence of congestive heart failure when compared with placebo recipients (hazard ratio, 0.72 [CI, 0.52 to 1.00]; P = 0.048) or amlodipine recipients (hazard ratio, 0.65 [CI, 0.48 to 0.87]; P = 0.004).The composite cardiovascular event rate did not differ in patients with type 2 diabetes and overt nephropathy treated with irbesartan, amlodipine, or placebo in addition to conventional antihypertensive therapy.Clinical events in high-risk hypertensive patients randomly assigned to calcium channel blocker versus angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor in the antihypertensive and lipid-lowering treatment to prevent heart attack trial.The Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering treatment to prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT) provides a unique opportunity to compare the long-term relative safety and efficacy of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and calcium channel blocker-initiated therapy in older hypertensive individuals. Patients were randomized to amlodipine (n=9048) or lisinopril (n=9054). The primary outcome was combined fatal coronary heart disease or nonfatal myocardial infarction, analyzed by intention-to-treat. Secondary outcomes included all-cause mortality, stroke, combined cardiovascular disease (CVD), end-stage renal disease (ESRD), cancer, and gastrointestinal bleeding. Mean follow-up was 4.9 years. Blood pressure control was similar in nonblacks, but not in blacks. No significant differences were found between treatment groups for the primary outcome, all-cause mortality, ESRD, or cancer. Stroke rates were higher on lisinopril in blacks (RR=1.51, 95% CI 1.22 to 1.86) but not in nonblacks (RR=1.07, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.28), and in women (RR=1.45, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.79), but not in men (RR=1.10, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.31). Rates of combined CVD were higher (RR=1.06, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.12) because of higher rates for strokes, peripheral arterial disease, and angina, which were partly offset by lower rates for heart failure (RR=0.87, 95% CI 0.78 to 0.96) on lisinopril compared with amlodipine. Gastrointestinal bleeds and angioedema were higher on lisinopril. Patients with and without baseline coronary heart disease showed similar outcome patterns. We conclude that in hypertensive patients, the risks for coronary events are similar, but for stroke, combined CVD, gastrointestinal bleeding, and angioedema are higher and for heart failure are lower for lisinopril-based compared with amlodipine-based therapy. Some, but not all, of these differences may be explained by less effective blood pressure control in the lisinopril arm.Cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in the Losartan Intervention For Endpoint reduction in hypertension study (LIFE): a randomised trial against atenolol.Blood pressure reduction achieved with beta-blockers and diuretics is the best recorded intervention to date for prevention of cardiovascular morbidity and death in patients with hypertension. Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is a strong independent indicator of risk of cardiovascular morbidity and death. We aimed to establish whether selective blocking of angiotensin II improves LVH beyond reducing blood pressure and, consequently, reduces cardiovascular morbidity and death.We did a double-masked, randomised, parallel-group trial in 9193 participants aged 55-80 years with essential hypertension (sitting blood pressure 160-200/95-115 mm Hg) and LVH ascertained by electrocardiography (ECG). We assigned participants once daily losartan-based or atenolol-based antihypertensive treatment for at least 4 years and until 1040 patients had a primary cardiovascular event (death, myocardial infarction, or stroke). We used Cox regression analysis to compare regimens.Blood pressure fell by 30.2/16.6 (SD 18.5/10.1) and 29.1/16.8 mm Hg (19.2/10.1) in the losartan and atenolol groups, respectively. The primary composite endpoint occurred in 508 losartan (23.8 per 1000 patient-years) and 588 atenolol patients (27.9 per 1000 patient-years; relative risk 0.87, 95% CI 0.77-0.98, p=0.021). 204 losartan and 234 atenolol patients died from cardiovascular disease (0.89, 0.73-1.07, p=0.206); 232 and 309, respectively, had fatal or non-fatal stroke (0.75, 0.63-0.89, p=0.001); and myocardial infarction (non-fatal and fatal) occurred in 198 and 188, respectively (1.07, 0.88-1.31, p=0.491). New-onset diabetes was less frequent with losartan. Interpretation Losartan prevents more cardiovascular morbidity and death than atenolol for a similar reduction in blood pressure and is better tolerated. Losartan seems to confer benefits beyond reduction in blood pressure.Effects of a beta-blocker or a converting enzyme inhibitor on resistance arteries in essential hypertension.Seventeen male untreated mild essential hypertensive patients aged 41 +/- 2 years agreed to participate in a double-blind randomized trial to test the effects of antihypertensive treatment on the structure and function of subcutaneous resistance arteries. Patients were treated with either 50 to 100 mg/d atenolol or 2.5 to 5 mg/d cilazapril. Blood pressure before treatment was 148 +/- 6/99 +/- 1 and 147 +/- 2/99 +/- 1 mm Hg, respectively. At 1 year of treatment blood pressure was 131 +/- 4/85 +/- 2 and 132 +/- 2/87 +/- 1 mm Hg, respectively. Resistance arteries (200 to 400 microns lumen diameter) dissected from subcutaneous gluteal biopsies obtained before treatment and at 1 year showed that the media-lumen ratio of arteries from patients treated with cilazapril was reduced to 6.31 +/- 0.21% from 7.54 +/- 0.31% before treatment (P < .05), still slightly but significantly larger (P < .05) than the media-lumen ratio of resistance arteries of normotensive control subjects (5.15 +/- 0.30%). In contrast, in arteries from patients treated with atenolol there was no significant change with treatment (7.97 +/- 0.60% before and 8.07 +/- 0.45% after 1 year of treatment). Active wall tension responses to endothelin-1 were blunted in hypertensive patients and normalized in the cilazapril-treated patients. Depressed active media stress responses to norepinephrine, arginine vasopressin, and endothelin-1 were accordingly normalized in the patients receiving cilazapril as the media width became thinner but were unchanged in those taking atenolol.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)The effect of nisoldipine as compared with enalapril on cardiovascular outcomes in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes and hypertension.It has recently been reported that the use of calcium-channel blockers for hypertension may be associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular complications. Because this issue remains controversial, we studied the incidence of such complications in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and hypertension who were randomly assigned to treatment with either the calcium-channel blocker nisoldipine or the angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor enalapril as part of a larger study.The Appropriate Blood Pressure Control in Diabetes (ABCD) Trial is a prospective, randomized, blinded trial comparing the effects of moderate control of blood pressure (target diastolic pressure, 80 to 89 mm Hg) with those of intensive control of blood pressure (diastolic pressure, 75 mm Hg) on the incidence and progression of complications of diabetes. The study also compared nisoldipine with enalapril as a first-line antihypertensive agent in terms of the prevention and progression of complications of diabetes. In the current study, we analyzed data on a secondary end point (the incidence of myocardial infarction) in the subgroup of patients in the ABCD Trial who had hypertension.Analysis of the 470 patients in the trial who had hypertension (base-line diastolic blood pressure, > or = 90 mm Hg) showed similar control of blood pressure, blood glucose and lipid concentrations, and smoking behavior in the nisoldipine group (237 patients) and the enalapril group (233 patients) throughout five years of follow-up. Using a multiple logistic-regression model with adjustment for cardiac risk factors, we found that nisoldipine was associated with a higher incidence of fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarctions (a total of 24) than enalapril (total, 4) (risk ratio, 9.5; 95 percent confidence interval, 2.7 to 33.8).In this population of patients with diabetes and hypertension, we found a significantly higher incidence of fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarction among those assigned to therapy with the calcium-channel blocker nisoldipine than among those assigned to receive enalapril. Since our findings are based on a secondary end point, they will require confirmation.Fasting glucose levels and incident diabetes mellitus in older nondiabetic adults randomized to receive 3 different classes of antihypertensive treatment: a report from the Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT).Elevated blood glucose levels are reported with thiazide-type diuretic treatment of hypertension. The significance of this finding is uncertain. Our objectives were to compare the effect of first-step antihypertensive drug therapy with thiazide-type diuretic, calcium-channel blocker, or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor on fasting glucose (FG) levels and to determine cardiovascular and renal disease risks associated with elevated FG levels and incident diabetes mellitus (DM) in 3 treatment groups.We performed post hoc subgroup analyses from the Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT) among nondiabetic participants who were randomized to receive treatment with chlorthalidone (n = 8419), amlodipine (n = 4958), or lisinopril (n = 5034) and observed for a mean of 4.9 years.Mean FG levels increased during follow-up in all treatment groups. At year 2, those randomized to the chlorthalidone group had the greatest increase (+8.5 mg/dL [0.47 mmol/L] vs +5.5 mg/dL [0.31 mmol/L] for amlodipine and +3.5 mg/dL [0.19 mmol/L] for lisinopril). The odds ratios for developing DM with lisinopril (0.55 [95% confidence interval, 0.43-0.70]) or amlodipine (0.73 [95% confidence interval, 0.58-0.91]) vs chlorthalidone at 2 years were significantly lower than 1.0 (P<.01). There was no significant association of FG level change at 2 years with subsequent coronary heart disease, stroke, cardiovascular disease, total mortality, or end-stage renal disease. There was no significant association of incident DM at 2 years with clinical outcomes, except for coronary heart disease (risk ratio, 1.64; P = .006), but the risk ratio was lower and nonsignificant in the chlorthalidone group (risk ratio, 1.46; P = .14).Fasting glucose levels increase in older adults with hypertension regardless of treatment type. For those taking chlorthalidone vs other medications, the risk of developing FG levels higher than 125 mg/dL (6.9 mmol/L) is modestly greater, but there is no conclusive or consistent evidence that this diuretic-associated increase in DM risk increases the risk of clinical events.Effects of doxazosin and irbesartan on blood pressure and metabolic control in patients with type 2 diabetes and hypertension.The objective of this trial was to compare the metabolic effects of long-term treatment with doxazosin to those of irbesartan in patients with type 2 diabetes and hypertension. We evaluated 96 hypertensive diabetic patients who were randomized to 12 months of double-blind treatment with doxazosin 4 mg/d or irbesartan 300 mg/d. At the end of the study, systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP) were significantly reduced from 152 to 140 mm Hg and from 97 to 87 mm Hg, respectively, with doxazosin (P < 0.01). SBP and DBP were reduced from 150 to 134 mm Hg and from 94 to 83 mm Hg, respectively, with irbesartan (P < 0.01). Irbesartan had significantly better antihypertensive efficacy than doxazosin (P < 0.05). Doxazosin had the greatest effect on glucose metabolism and lipid parameters, with significant (P </= 0.05) reductions observed at study end compared with baseline in glycosylated hemoglobin, fasting plasma glucose, fasting plasma insulin, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, and Homeostasis Model Assessment Index. In conclusion, both doxazosin and irbesartan reduced BP during long-term treatment, but not to recommended levels, and doxazosin had the more beneficial effect on glucose metabolism and lipid profile.A comparison of outcomes with angiotensin-converting--enzyme inhibitors and diuretics for hypertension in the elderly.Treatment of hypertension with diuretics, beta-blockers, or both leads to improved outcomes. It has been postulated that agents that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system confer benefit beyond the reduction of blood pressure alone. We compared the outcomes in older subjects with hypertension who were treated with angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors with the outcomes in those treated with diuretic agents.We conducted a prospective, randomized, open-label study with blinded assessment of end points in 6083 subjects with hypertension who were 65 to 84 years of age and received health care at 1594 family practices. Subjects were followed for a median of 4.1 years, and the total numbers of cardiovascular events in the two treatment groups were compared with the use of multivariate proportional-hazards models.At base line, the treatment groups were well matched in terms of age, sex, and blood pressure. By the end of the study, blood pressure had decreased to a similar extent in both groups (a decrease of 26/12 mm Hg). There were 695 cardiovascular events or deaths from any cause in the ACE-inhibitor group (56.1 per 1000 patient-years) and 736 cardiovascular events or deaths from any cause in the diuretic group (59.8 per 1000 patient-years; the hazard ratio for a cardiovascular event or death with ACE-inhibitor treatment was 0.89 [95 percent confidence interval, 0.79 to 1.00]; P=0.05). Among male subjects, the hazard ratio was 0.83 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.71 to 0.97; P=0.02); among female subjects, the hazard ratio was 1.00 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.83 to 1.21; P=0.98); the P value for the interaction between sex and treatment-group assignment was 0.15. The rates of nonfatal cardiovascular events and myocardial infarctions decreased with ACE-inhibitor treatment, whereas a similar number of strokes occurred in each group (although there were more fatal strokes in the ACE-inhibitor group).Initiation of antihypertensive treatment involving ACE inhibitors in older subjects, particularly men, appears to lead to better outcomes than treatment with diuretic agents, despite similar reductions of blood pressure.Effect of antihypertensive treatment on retinal microvascular changes in hypertension.Hypertension causes arteriolar narrowing and rarefaction in the retinal circulation, but the extent to which these changes are reversible by antihypertensive treatment is not well studied. We compared the effect of antihypertensive treatment with a calcium-channel-blocker-based regimen and an angiotensin-converting-enzyme-inhibitor-based regimen on the retinal microvasculature.Twenty-five patients (17 men, age range 24-71 years) with untreated hypertension were randomized to treatment with an amlodipine-based (n = 12) or lisinopril-based (n = 13) regimen in a double-blind, prospective parallel limb trial for 52 weeks. Measurements of blood pressure and the retinal microvasculature were made at baseline and at the end of the study.Both the amlodipine-based and lisinopril-based treatments reduced blood pressure to similar extents. Blood pressure reduction was associated with a reduction in arteriolar narrowing, a widening of arteriolar branch angle and an increase in arteriolar density. There were no significant differences between the two treatment regimens.Antihypertensive treatment is associated with improvement in arteriolar narrowing and rarefaction. Improved microvascular structure may contribute to the beneficial effects of antihypertensive treatment in hypertension.Equivalence of indapamide SR and enalapril on microalbuminuria reduction in hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes: the NESTOR Study.To test whether microalbuminuria in patients with type 2 diabetes and hypertension is primarily dependent on the severity of hypertension, and to compare the effectiveness of two antihypertensive drugs with opposite effects on the renin-angiotensin system [the diuretic, indapamide sustained release (SR), and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, enalapril] in reducing microalbuminuria.A multinational, multicentre, controlled, double-blind, double-dummy, randomized, two-parallel-groups study over 1 year.After a 4-week placebo run-in period, 570 patients (ages 60.0 +/- 9.9 years, 64% men) with type 2 diabetes, essential hypertension [systolic blood pressure (SBP) 140-180 mmHg, and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) < 110 mmHg], and persistent microalbuminuria (20-200 microg/min) were allocated randomly to groups to receive indapamide SR 1.5 mg (n = 284) or enalapril 10 mg (n = 286) once a day. Amlodipine, atenolol, or both were added, if necessary, to achieve the target blood pressure of 140/85 mmHg.There was a significant reduction in the urinary albumin : creatinine ratio. Mean reductions were 35% [95% confidence interval (CI) 24 to 43] and 39% (95% CI 30 to 47%) in the indapamide SR and enalapril groups, respectively. Equivalence was demonstrated between the two groups [1.08 (95% CI 0.89 to 1.31%); P = 0.01]. The reductions in mean arterial pressure (MAP) were 16.6 +/- 9.0 mmHg for the indapamide SR group and 15.0 +/- 9.1 mmHg for the enalapril group (NS); the reduction in SBP was significantly greater (P = 0.0245 ) with indapamide SR. More than 50% of patients in each group required additional antihypertensive therapy, with no differences between groups. Both treatments were well tolerated.Indapamide-SR-based therapy is equivalent to enalapril-based therapy in reducing microalbuminuria with effective blood pressure reduction in patients with hypertension and type 2 diabetes.Comparison of losartan and hydrochlorothiazide on cognitive function and quality of life in hypertensive patients.We examined long-term changes in cognitive function and quality of life (QL) in hypertensive patients by comparing the antihypertensive effect of hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) and losartan. We studied 69 patients (age range, 30 to 73 years) with mild-to-moderate hypertension. All patients, in a double-blind study, were randomly allocated to either treatment with 50 mg losartan once daily or 25 mg HCTZ once daily. The sample in each treatment group was divided by age (younger than 60 years or 60 years or older). At baseline and after 26 months, a QL questionnaire appropriate for the hypertensive patients was given. Cognitive function was evaluated, at baseline and after 26 months, by psychometric tests consisting of items from the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Sandoz Clinical Assessment Geriatric (SCAG). A score of less than 24 on the MMSE and more than 40 on the SCAG was predictive of cognitive impairment. The losartan group had a significant improvement in SCAG (P<.001) and MMSE (P<.001). No significant changes were observed in the HCTZ group (SCAG, P = .1; MMSE, P = .2). Sixty-five percent of the elderly had a MMSE score less than 24 and 70% had a SCAG score greater than 40, v. 35% and 48%, respectively, in younger patients. The health state index of QL improved significantly in both groups (losartan group, P<.01; HCTZ group, P<.02); the improvement in QL scores in patients using HCTZ was significant only in subjects aged 60 years and older (P<.04). These results suggest that losartan can have a positive effect not only on blood pressure but also on impaired cognitive function, reversing even minimal cognitive deficits induced by hypertension. The elderly patients in our sample had worse scores and cognitive performance was lower than in younger patients, even if in the losartan group the score improvement was the same at all ages. The same could not be said for HCTZ.The influence of antihypertensive therapy on the structural arteriolar changes in essential hypertension: different effects of enalapril and hydrochlorothiazide.To assess the peripheral and central haemodynamics, in particular the effect on minimal resistance in the hand, with an ACE inhibitor in comparison with a diuretic.Double-blind randomized parallel group study.Twenty-eight previously untreated men with essential hypertension (supine diastolic blood pressure > 95 mmHg repeatedly on placebo). METHODS/INTERVENTION: Causal and intra-arterial blood pressure, dye-dilution technique, water plethysmography at rest and at ischaemia, enalapril (n = 14), hydrochlorothiazide (n = 14).After 6 months the mean arterial pressure was reduced from 112.7 to 96.9 mmHg (change -15.9 mmHg; 95% confidence interval (CI) -21.9, -9.8) on enalapril and from 110.1 to 101.5 mmHg (change -8.6 mmHg; CI -14.4, -2.8). Heart rate did not change on any of the therapies. Enalapril reduced blood pressure mainly through a reduction in total peripheral resistance (delta -3.0 PRU100; CI -5.6, -0.4) while hydrochlorothiazide reduced blood pressure mainly through a reduction in cardiac output (delta -0.8 l/min-1; CI -1.5, -0.07). Minimal vascular resistance (mean of right and left hand) displayed a significant time x treatment interaction indicating a different trend with enalapril than hydrochlorothiazide with a change of -0.12 PRU100 (CI -0.33, 0.05) on enalapril and a change of 0.14 (CI -0.29, 0.56) on hydrochlorothiazide. The resistance level after 6 months was significantly higher on hydrochlorothiazide than on enalapril (P = 0.0105).Enalapril reduced blood pressure through vasodilatation and hydrochlorothiazide through decreased cardiac output. The two therapies also affected minimal vascular resistance (an indirect measure of vascular wall thickness) differently; with enalapril showing a favourable response in contrast to hydrochlorothiazide.Effects of nisoldipine and lisinopril on microvascular dysfunction in hypertensive Type I diabetes patients with nephropathy.1. Our objective was to compare the effect of a long-acting calcium antagonist (nisoldipine) compared with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (lisinopril) on the non-neurogenic regulation of the microvascular blood flow in hypertensive Type I diabetes patients with diabetic nephropathy.2. We performed a 1-year double-blind, double-dummy randomized controlled study comparing nisoldipine (20-40 mg once daily) with lisinopril (10-20 mg once daily) in 48 hypertensive Type I diabetes patients with diabetic nephropathy. For comparison, 22 age-matched normotensive healthy control subjects were included. Measurements were performed at baseline and after 1 year of antihypertensive treatment. The minimal vascular resistance and distensibility (stiffness) of resistance vessels in skin and skeletal muscle were measured using the local isotope washout method.3. Mean arterial pressure was reduced to the same extent in both groups: nisoldipine, 113+/-2.1 to 105+/-1.6 mmHg (P<0.001); lisinopril, 110+/-2.7 to 101+/-2.1 mmHg (P<0.002) (controls, 88+/-2.2 mmHg; P<0.0001 compared with diabetic patients). Nisoldipine improved the skin vascular distensibility from 28+/-3.3 to 43+/-3.8% (P<0.005) and decreased skin minimal vascular resistance from 16.9+/-1.0 to 13.6+/-0.8 mmHg.ml-1.min.100 g (P<0. 02). Lisinopril had no significant effect on skin vascular distensibility (40+/-4.0% and 41+/-4.4%), but minimal vascular resistance tended to diminish (18.1+/-0.9 to 15.8+/-1.3 mmHg.ml-1. min.100 g (P=0.09). Nisoldipine significantly increased the skin distensibility (P=0.05) after 1 year of antihypertensive treatment compared with lisinopril.4. The control group had a skin vascular distensibility of 54+/-3.2% and a minimal vascular resistance of 10. 8+/-0.7 mmHg.ml-1.min.100 g, both significantly different from the values in the diabetic groups (P<0.0001 for all). Skeletal muscle vascular distensibility was unaltered after 1 year of treatment with both nisoldipine (22+/-3.3% and 19+/-2.7%) and lisinopril (19+/-2.1% and 24+/-2.5%), but was reduced compared with a control value of 43+/-3.7% (P<0.0001 for diabetes patients versus controls). However, neither nisoldipine nor lisinopril had any effect on the increased minimal vascular resistance or the reduced skeletal muscle distensibility.5. Enhanced thickening of the basement membranes of the terminal arteriolar wall was found in skin biopsy specimens in 91% of diabetic patients and 38% only in control subjects (P<0. 000001 both before and after treatment for diabetic patients versus controls). There was no significant effect of antihypertensive treatment on arteriolar hyalinosis.6. The reduction in systemic blood pressure was identical during 1 year of treatment with nisoldipine or lisinopril. The abnormal arteriolar stiffness was more pronounced in the group treated with nisoldipine than with lisinopril and only nisoldipine compared with lisinopril improved the abnormal arteriolar stiffness and minimal vascular resistance in the skin. This suggests that nisoldipine can reverse the peripheral skin perfusion and thereby improve the local protection against development of ischaemic skin lesions in Type I diabetes patients with clinical diabetic nephropathy.Preventing microalbuminuria in type 2 diabetes.The multicenter double-blind, randomized Bergamo Nephrologic Diabetes Complications Trial (BENEDICT) was designed to assess whether angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors and non-dihydropyridine calcium-channel blockers, alone or in combination, prevent microalbuminuria in subjects with hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and normal urinary albumin excretion.We studied 1204 subjects, who were randomly assigned to receive at least three years of treatment with trandolapril (at a dose of 2 mg per day) plus verapamil (sustained-release formulation, 180 mg per day), trandolapril alone (2 mg per day), verapamil alone (sustained-release formulation, 240 mg per day), or placebo. The target blood pressure was 120/80 mm Hg. The primary end point was the development of persistent microalbuminuria (overnight albumin excretion, > or =20 microg per minute at two consecutive visits).The primary outcome was reached in 5.7 percent of the subjects receiving trandolapril plus verapamil, 6.0 percent of the subjects receiving trandolapril, 11.9 percent of the subjects receiving verapamil, and 10.0 percent of control subjects receiving placebo. The estimated acceleration factor (which quantifies the effect of one treatment relative to another in accelerating or slowing disease progression) adjusted for predefined baseline characteristics was 0.39 for the comparison between verapamil plus trandolapril and placebo (P=0.01), 0.47 for the comparison between trandolapril and placebo (P=0.01), and 0.83 for the comparison between verapamil and placebo (P=0.54). Trandolapril plus verapamil and trandolapril alone delayed the onset of microalbuminuria by factors of 2.6 and 2.1, respectively. Serious adverse events were similar in all treatment groups.In subjects with type 2 diabetes and hypertension but with normoalbuminuria, the use of trandolapril plus verapamil and trandolapril alone decreased the incidence of microalbuminuria to a similar extent. The effect of verapamil alone was similar to that of placebo.Effect of lercanidipine compared with ramipril on albumin excretion rate in hypertensive Type 2 diabetic patients with microalbuminuria: DIAL study (diabete, ipertensione, albuminuria, lercanidipina).Microalbuminuria and hypertension are risk factors for diabetic nephropathy in Type 2 diabetic patients. Recent data suggest that blockade of the renin-angiotensin system slows the progression of diabetic nephropathy; in contrast, the results on the renoprotective effect of calcium channel antagonists are conflicting. We evaluated the effectiveness of lercanidipine, in comparison with ramipril, on the reduction in albumin excretion rate (AER) and blood pressure in mild-to-moderate hypertensive patients with Type 2 diabetes and persistent microalbuminuria. A total of 277 patients were enrolled in a multicentric, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, parallel-group trial; 180 were randomized to receive 10-20 mg/day of lercanidipine or 5-10 mg/day of ramipril and followed up for 9-12 months. The primary outcome was the change in AER from baseline. After 9-12 months of follow-up, a reduction in AER of -17.4+/-65 microg/min (p<0.05) and -19.7+/-52.5 (p<0.05) in the lercanidipine and ramipril group, respectively, was observed, without differences between the groups. A significant reduction in systolic and diastolic blood pressure was observed in both the lercanidipine and ramipril-based treatment groups (p<0.0001 for both). This study demonstrated that treatment with lercanidipine 10-20 mg/day does not worsen albuminuria in microalbuminuric Type 2 diabetic patients with hypertension. Indeed, both lercanidipine and ramipril treatments resulted in a significant reduction in AER without a statistically significant difference between the two groups.The Valsartan Antihypertensive Long-term Use Evaluation (VALUE) trial of cardiovascular events in hypertension. Rationale and design.Essential hypertension is a major Public Health issue. Although the number of treated hypertensive patients has increased, only 25% of treated patients have their blood pressure levels under control. The benefit of treating hypertension has been proven, but cardiovascular morbidity and mortality rates remain high. The ideal antihypertensive drug should not only normalize blood pressure levels, but also reduce the associated cardiovascular morbidity and mortality rates. The role of angiotensin II in systemic hypertension and its complications has been recently redefined. The potent trophic effects of angiotensin II on blood vessels and on cardiac cells have been well demonstrated, especially the role of angiotensin II in left ventricular hypertrophy, vascular hypertrophy, endothelial dysfunction, and congestive heart failure. Of all ongoing mortality and morbidity trials in systemic hypertension, VALUE (Valsartan Antihypertensive Long-term Use Evaluation) is the only one comparing an angiotensin II antagonist (valsartan) with a third-generation calcium channel blocker (amlodipine). The main hypothesis of the VALUE trial is that, for an equivalent decrease in blood pressure, valsartan will be more effective than amlodipine in decreasing cardiac mortality and morbidity. VALUE is a prospective, multinational, multicentre, double-blind, randomized, active-controlled, 2-arm parallel group comparison with a response-dependent dose titration scheme. VALUE involves 14,400 patients in over 30 countries, who will be followed for 4 years or until 1450 patients experience a primary endpoint. The population to be included in VALUE consists of hypertensive men and women, aged 50 years or older, and at a relatively high risk of sustaining a cardiovascular event. The high risk profile is defined taking into account age, gender, and a list of cardiovascular risk factors and disease factors. Risk factors are cigarette smoking, hypercholesterolaemia, diabetes mellitus, uncomplicated left ventricular hypertrophy, proteinuria, and high serum creatinine. Disease factors include documented history of myocardial infarction, peripheral vascular disease, stroke or transient ischaemic attack, or the presence of left ventricular hypertrophy with strain on the ECG. A unique feature of VALUE is the assessment of the predictive power of this cardiovascular risk factor scale in a large population of treated hypertensive patients. The trial started on 10 September 1997.Myocardial perfusion during long-term angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition or beta-blockade in patients with essential hypertension.Hypertension is associated with reduced coronary vasodilatory capacity, possibly caused by structural changes in the coronary resistance vessels. Because vasodilatory treatment may correct abnormal structure better than nonvasodilating treatment, we compared whether long-term angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition has a greater effect on coronary reserve and cardiovascular structure than beta-blockade in patients with essential hypertension. Thirty previously untreated hypertensive patients were randomized in a double-blind design to treatment for 1 year with either perindopril (4 to 8 mg per day, n=15) or atenolol (50 to 100 mg per day, n=15) and furthermore compared with normotensive controls. Cardiac output and left ventricular mass were measured with echocardiography and resistance artery structure was determined in vitro. Using positron emission tomography, myocardial perfusion (MP) was determined at rest and during dipyridamole-induced hyperemia while still on medication. Perindopril reduced left ventricular mass by 14+/-4% (P<0.01), peripheral vascular resistance by 12+/-6% (P<0.01), and media thickness-to-lumen diameter ratio of resistance arteries by 16+/-4% (P<0.05), whereas atenolol had no effect. Resting MP was decreased both by perindopril (-11+/-4%, P<0.01) and by atenolol (-25+/-4%, P<0.01) in parallel to the reduction in rate pressure product. Hyperemic MP was unaltered by perindopril (+2+/-6%, P=NS), but reduced by atenolol (-32+/-5%, P<0.01). Compared with atenolol, perindopril treatment resulted in higher coronary reserve (P<0.05). We conclude that compared with beta-blockade, ACE inhibition increases coronary reserve and results in regression of hypertensive resistance artery structure and left ventricular hypertrophy. Vasodilating may thus be superior to nonvasodilating treatment in repairing the hypertensive myocardial microcirculation.Effects of once-daily angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition and calcium channel blockade-based antihypertensive treatment regimens on left ventricular hypertrophy and diastolic filling in hypertension: the prospective randomized enalapril study evaluating regression of ventricular enlargement (preserve) trial.The Prospective Randomized Enalapril Study Evaluating Regression of Ventricular Enlargement (PRESERVE) study was designed to test whether enalapril achieves greater left ventricular (LV) mass reduction than does a nifedipine gastrointestinal treatment system by a prognostically meaningful degree on a population basis (10 g/m(2)).An ethnically diverse population of 303 men and women with essential hypertension and increased LV mass at screening echocardiography were enrolled at clinical centers on 4 continents and studied by echocardiography at baseline and after 6- and 12-month randomized therapy. Clinical examination and blinded echocardiogram readings 48 weeks after study entry in an intention-to-treat analysis of 113 enalapril-treated and 122 nifedipine-treated patients revealed similar reductions in systolic/diastolic pressure (-22/12 versus -21/13 mm Hg) and LV mass index (-15 versus -17g/m(2), both P>0.20). No significant between-treatment difference was detected in population subsets defined by monotherapy treatment, sex, age, race, or severity of baseline hypertrophy. Similarly, there was no between-treatment difference in change in velocities of early diastolic or atrial phase transmitral blood flow. More enalapril-treated than nifedipine-treated patients required supplemental treatment with hydrochlorothiazide (59% versus 34%, P<0.001) but not atenolol (27% versus 22%, NS).Once-daily antihypertensive treatment with enalapril or long-acting nifedipine, plus adjunctive hydrochlorothiazide and atenolol when needed to control blood pressure, both had moderately beneficial and statistically indistinguishable effects on regression of LV hypertrophy.Renal and cardiac effects of antihypertensive treatment with ramipril vs metoprolol in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease.Hypertension is a common complication in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). This prospective randomized double-blind study was performed to compare the renal and cardiac effects of the ACE inhibitor ramipril and the beta-blocker metoprolol as first line therapy in ADPKD patients with hypertension.Forty-six hypertensive ADPKD patients were randomized to either ramipril (n = 23) or metoprolol (n = 23). Twenty-four hour (24-h) ambulatory blood pressure (BP), glomerular filtration rate (GFR) as calculated by the Cockcroft and Gault formula, urinary albumin excretion (albumin/creatinine ratio), and left ventricular mass index (LVMI) were established at baseline and at yearly intervals. The total follow-up was 3 years. Baseline characteristics were similar in both groups.Mean arterial pressure (MAP) decreased significantly in both the ramipril and the metoprolol group (-8 +/- 2 and -6 +/- 2 mmHg; both P < 0.01). There was a significant decline in renal function during follow-up which was similar in patients treated with ramipril or metoprolol (-2.5 +/- 0.7 vs -2.9 +/- 0.8 ml/min/year; P = NS). After the 3 years follow-up, no differences in GFR, LVMI and urinary albumin excretion were observed between the ramipril and the metoprolol group (80.7 +/- 10.7 vs 78.0 +/- 7.6 ml/min, 102.6 +/- 6.8 vs 100.3 +/- 5.4 g/m(2); and 42.6 +/- 12.3 vs 70.3 +/- 32.5 mg/g, respectively; all P = NS). A post-hoc analysis evaluating the effects of BP control, revealed that LVMI increased in patients with standard BP control while it remained stable in patients with rigorous BP control with a significant difference in LVMI between the groups after 3 years of follow-up (110.5 +/- 6.3 vs 90.9 +/- 4.7 g/m(2); P = 0.017). Also, by the end of the study albuminuria was lower in patients with rigorous vs standard BP control (23.5 +/- 6.7 vs 94.8 +/- 35.4 mg/g; P = 0.05).In our study population of hypertensive ADPKD patients, no differences in renal function, urinary albumin excretion and LVMI were detected between those treated with ramipril or metoprolol, respectively, during a 3 years follow-up. Rigorous BP control prevented an increase in LVMI and reduced urinary albumin excretion, suggesting a crucial role of BP control for slowing progression of cardiac and renal organ damage in ADPKD.Serial evaluation of electrocardiographic left ventricular hypertrophy for prediction of risk in hypertensive patients.Although the presence and severity of electrocardiographic (ECG) left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) have been associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular (CV) morbidity and mortality, the relationship of regression of ECG LVH during antihypertensive therapy to CV risk has only recently been examined.Electrocardiographic LVH was evaluated over time in 9193 hypertensive patients enrolled in the Losartan Intervention for Endpoint Reduction in Hypertension study. Patients were treated with losartan- or atenolol-based regimens and followed with serial ECGs at 6 months and then yearly until death or study end. Electrocardiographic LVH was measured using gender-adjusted Cornell product (RaVL + SV3 [+6 mm in women]) QRS duration) and Sokolow-Lyon voltage (SV1 + RV5/6).After mean (SD) follow-up of 4.8 (0.9) years, the Losartan Intervention for Endpoint Reduction in Hypertension study composite end point of CV death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or stroke occurred in 1096 patients. In Cox regression models controlling for treatment type, baseline Framingham risk score, baseline, and in-treatment blood pressure and for severity of baseline ECG LVH by Cornell product and Sokolow-Lyon voltage, lower in-treatment ECG LVH by Cornell product and Sokolow-Lyon voltage were associated with 14% and 17% lower rates, respectively, of the composite CV end point: adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) of 0.86 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.82-0.90; P < .001) for every 1050 mm . ms (1 SD) decrease in Cornell product and 0.83 (95% CI, 0.78-0.88; P < .001) for every 10.5 mm (1 SD) decrease in Sokolow-Lyon voltage. In parallel analyses, lower Cornell product and Sokolow- Lyon voltage were each independently associated with lower risks of CV mortality (HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.73-0.83; P < .001; HR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.73-0.87; P < .001), of myocardial infarction (HR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.82-0.98; P = .011; HR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.81-1.00; P = .043), and of stroke (HR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.84-0.96; P = .002; HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.75-0.89; P < .001). Regression of ECG LVH was also associated with significantly reduced risks of sudden cardiac death, new-onset atrial fibrillation, hospitalization for heart failure, and new-onset diabetes mellitus.Regression of ECG LVH by Cornell product and/or Sokolow-Lyon voltage criteria during antihypertensive therapy is associated with lower likelihoods of CV morbidity and mortality, all-cause mortality, and new-onset diabetes, independent of blood pressure lowering and treatment modality in essential hypertension. These findings suggest that antihypertensive therapy targeted at regression or prevention of ECG LVH may improve prognosis.Relationship of sudden cardiac death to new-onset atrial fibrillation in hypertensive patients with left ventricular hypertrophy.Prevalent atrial fibrillation (AF) is associated with a higher sudden cardiac death (SCD) rate in some populations, and incident AF predicts increased mortality risk in the general population and after myocardial infarction. However, the relationship of SCD to new-onset AF is unclear.The relationship of SCD to new-onset AF was evaluated in 8831 hypertensive patients with electrocardiographic left ventricular hypertrophy with no history of AF, in sinus rhythm on their baseline electrocardiogram, randomly assigned to losartan- or atenolol-based treatment. During 4.7±1.1 years mean follow-up, new-onset AF occurred in 701 patients (7.9%) and SCD in 151 patients (1.7%). In univariate Cox analyses, new-onset AF was associated with a >4-fold higher risk of SCD (hazard ratio, 4.69; 95% CI interval, 2.96-7.45; P<0.001). In multivariate Cox analyses adjusting for age, sex, race, diabetes mellitus, history of heart failure, myocardial infarction, ischemic heart disease, stroke, smoking, serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, creatinine, glucose, and urine albumin/creatinine ratio as standard risk factors, and for incident myocardial infarction, in-treatment use of digoxin, systolic and diastolic pressure, heart rate, QRS duration, Cornell voltage-duration product, and Sokolow-Lyon voltage left ventricular hypertrophy treated as time-varying covariates, new-onset AF remained associated with a >3-fold increased risk of SCD (hazard ratio, 3.13; 95% confidence interval, 1.87-5.24; P<0.001).Development of new-onset AF identifies hypertensive patients at increased risk of SCD.URL: http://www.clinicaltrials.gov. Unique identifier: NCT00338260.Differential effects of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition and diuretic therapy on reductions in ambulatory blood pressure, left ventricular mass, and vascular hypertrophy.Diuretic-based therapy is less effective in reducing the cardiac complications of hypertension than the risk of stroke and may be less effective in reducing left ventricular (LV) mass than is therapy with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition. In view of the strong association of LV hypertrophy with cardiovascular risk, this study was designed to compare the impact of therapy with a diuretic and ACE inhibition on cardiac and vascular structure. Fifty essential hypertensives (74% male, 88% nonwhite) participated in a double-blind study for 6 months and were randomized to either ramipril or hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ). Echocardiography, carotid ultrasonography, and ambulatory blood pressure (BP) monitoring were performed at baseline and 3 and 6 months after initiation of therapy. The 22 ramipril patients were comparable to the 28 HCTZ patients at baseline in age, race, and 24-h BP. Although HCTZ resulted in a greater reduction in 24-h BP, only treatment with ramipril resulted in a decrease in LV mass (193 to 179 g, P < .005, v 184 to 182 g, P = NS), attributable to a reduction in wall thicknesses but not in chamber diameter. In multivariate analysis, both change in BP and treatment group were independent predictors of change in LV mass. Importantly, although neither drug reduced carotid artery cross-sectional area, relative wall thickness increased due to a tendency for vessel diameter to decrease and wall thickness to increase, particularly in the diuretic group. Ramipril caused a sustained fall in plasma angiotensin II, whereas HCTZ increased angiotensin II levels. Although diuretic therapy was more effective in lowering ambulatory BP in this predominantly nonwhite population, only therapy with ACE inhibition was associated with regression of LV mass. Vascular geometry was altered consistent with the reduction in distending pressure resulting in vascular remodelling.Candesartan- and atenolol-based treatments induce different patterns of carotid artery and left ventricular remodeling in hypertension.Angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB)-based treatment reduces cardiovascular events and stroke more than does beta-blocker-based treatment despite similar blood pressure (BP) reduction. We investigated whether these treatments have different effects on cardiac and large-artery remodelling and evaluated the relation of arterial remodelling to hemodynamic changes in subjects with hypertension.We compared the treatment effects of an ARB (candesartan cilexetil)-based regimen and a beta-blocker (atenolol)-based regimen for 52 weeks on common carotid artery (CCA) and left ventricular structure in hypertensive patients in a randomized, double-blind study. Clinic brachial BP and 24-hour ambulatory BP, carotid BP, left ventricular mass index, CCA intima-media thickness, lumen diameter, intima-media area, and carotid blood flow were measured. Distensibility, circumferential tensile stress, Young's elastic modulus (E(m)), and shear stress (tau) in the CCA were also calculated.Both candesartan and atenolol reduced intima-media thickness and intima-media area and increased distensibility to similar extents after 52 weeks of treatment. Despite similar reductions in BP, treatment with atenolol resulted in a lesser reduction in left ventricular mass index, a decrease in lumen diameter, and a reduction in carotid blood flow compared with candesartan.BP-independent effects of ARB on cardiac and arterial structure may contribute to the beneficial effects of these agents on cardiovascular disease.Effect of single-drug therapy on reduction of left atrial size in mild to moderate hypertension: comparison of six antihypertensive agents.Cardiac effects of hypertension include increased left ventricular (LV) mass and LV hypertrophy, as well as increased left atrial size, a predictor of stroke and atrial fibrillation. Although literature on reduction of LV mass with antihypertensive therapy is extensive, little information is available on effects of treatment on left atrial size.Patients with mild to moderate hypertension (diastolic blood pressure 95 to 109 mm Hg) were randomly allocated to treatment with atenolol, captopril, clonidine, diltiazem, hydrochlorothiazide, or prazosin in a double-masked trial. Two-dimensional targeted M-mode echocardiography was used to assess left atrial size and LV mass at baseline, 8 weeks, and 1 and 2 years. Longitudinal analysis examined changes in left atrial size from the baseline study, statistically adjusting for age, race, pretreatment left atrial size and LV mass, and serial measurements of systolic blood pressure, body weight, urinary sodium excretion, and physical activity score. Without adjustment for covariates, only hydrochlorothiazide was associated with decreases in left atrial size from baseline at 8 weeks (-1.0 +/- 5.2 mm; P=0.052), 1 year (-2.0 +/- 5.1 mm; P=0.02), and 2 years (4.6+/-7.2 mm; P=0.002). After adjustment for effects of covariates, patients with normal left atrial size had greater reduction (-3.3 mm) in left atrial size at 2 years with hydrochlorothiazide than with any other drug. For patients with left atrial enlargement, left atrial size decreased significantly with hydrochlorothiazide, atenolol, clonidine, and diltiazem at 1 year and with all treatments at 2 years. However, reduction at 2 years was greater with hydrochlorothiazide than with captopril or prazosin.Antihypertensive drugs differ in their effects on left atrial size. Hydrochlorothiazide was associated with greater overall reduction of left atrial size than other drugs effective for the treatment of hypertension. Reduction of left atrial size with therapy is in part independent of factors known to influence left atrial size, including LV mass and reduction of LV mass with treatment. The clinical benefit of reducing left atrial size with antihypertensive treatment remains to be determined.Effects of nitrendipine and enalapril on left ventricular mass in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and hypertension.To compare the effects of a calcium antagonist (nitrendipine) and an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (enalapril) with those of placebo on left ventricular mass in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and hypertension.A double-blind randomized, placebo-controlled trial.General practitioners referred patients to the trial physician.The study population comprised 121 patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Inclusion criteria for blood pressure were diastolic blood pressure 90-115 mmHg and systolic blood pressure < or = 200 mmHg, while subjects were not being administered blood-pressure-lowering drugs for 3 weeks.Patients were randomly allocated to receive nitrendipine (n = 40), enalapril (n = 40) or placebo (n = 41). The treatment period was 48 weeks.The effect of nitrendipine was defined as the difference in change in left ventricular mass index from baseline between nitrendipine treatment and placebo after 48 weeks of treatment. The effects of nitrendipine compared with that of enalapril and of enalapril compared with placebo were defined similarly. Left ventricular mass was measured by M-mode echocardiography.Use of nitrendipine and enalapril led to significant and almost identical reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressures. During 48 weeks left ventricular mass index decreased by 5% for patients in the nitrendipine group (decrease by 12 g/m2, 95% confidence interval 1-23), remained about the same for patients in the enalapril group (decrease by 1 g/m2, 95% confidence interval decrease by 10 to increase by 9) and increased by 9% for patients in the placebo group (increase by 9 g/m2, 95% confidence interval 2-16).These results indicate that administration of nitrendipine to patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and hypertension reduces left ventricular mass index. Enalapril appears not to induce regression, but perhaps prevents progression with an effect that is intermediate between those of nitrendipine and placebo.Renal outcomes in high-risk hypertensive patients treated with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or a calcium channel blocker vs a diuretic: a report from the Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT).This study was performed to determine whether, in high-risk hypertensive patients with a reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR), treatment with a calcium channel blocker or an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor lowers the incidence of renal disease outcomes compared with treatment with a diuretic.We conducted post hoc analyses of the Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT). Hypertensive participants 55 years or older with at least 1 other coronary heart disease risk factor were randomized to receive chlorthalidone, amlodipine, or lisinopril for a mean of 4.9 years. Renal outcomes were incidence of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and/or a decrement in GFR of 50% or more from baseline. Baseline GFR, estimated by the simplified Modification of Diet in Renal Disease equation, was stratified into normal or increased (> or =90 mL /min per 1.73 m(2), n = 8126), mild reduction (60-89 mL /min per 1.73 m(2), n = 18 109), or moderate-severe reduction (<60 mL /min per 1.73 m(2), n = 5662) in GFR. Each stratum was analyzed for effects of the treatments on outcomes.In 448 participants, ESRD developed. Compared with patients taking chlorthalidone, no significant differences occurred in the incidence of ESRD in patients taking amlodipine in the mild (relative risk [RR], 1.47; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.97-2.23) or moderate-severe (RR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.68-1.24) reduction in GFR groups. Compared with patients taking chlorthalidone, no significant differences occurred in the incidence of ESRD in patients taking lisinopril in the mild (RR, 1.34; 95% CI, 0.87-2.06) or moderate-severe (RR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.73-1.31) reduction in GFR groups. In patients with mild and moderate-severe reduction in GFR, the incidence of ESRD or 50% or greater decrement in GFR was not significantly different in patients treated with chlorthalidone compared with those treated with amlodipine (odds ratios, 0.96 [P = .74] and 0.85 [P = .23], respectively) and lisinopril (odds ratios, 1.13 [P = .31] and 1.00 [P = .98], respectively). No difference in treatment effects occurred for either end point for patients taking amlodipine or lisinopril compared with those taking chlorthalidone across the 3 GFR subgroups, either for the total group or for participants with diabetes at baseline. At 4 years of follow-up, estimated GFR was 3 to 6 mL /min per 1.73 m(2) higher in patients assigned to receive amlodipine compared with chlorthalidone, depending on baseline GFR stratum.In hypertensive patients with reduced GFR, neither amlodipine nor lisinopril was superior to chlorthalidone in reducing the rate of development of ESRD or a 50% or greater decrement in GFR. Participants assigned to receive amlodipine had a higher GFR than those assigned to receive chlorthalidone, but rates of development of ESRD were not different between the groups.Effect of antihypertensive therapy on cognitive function in early executive cognitive impairment: a double-blind randomized clinical trial.Effects of losartan in women with hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy: results from the Losartan Intervention for Endpoint Reduction in Hypertension Study.Hypertension is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease and outcomes in women. These posthoc analyses from the Losartan Intervention For Endpoint reduction in hypertension (LIFE) study evaluated losartan- versus atenolol-based therapy on the primary composite end point of cardiovascular death, stroke, and myocardial infarction and other end points in 4963 women. Fewer events occurred in women versus men. Women in the losartan group had significant reductions in the primary end point (215 [18.2 per 1000 patient-years] versus 261 [22.5 per 1000 patient-years]; hazard ratio [HR]: 0.82 [95% CI: 0.68 to 0.98]; P=0.031), stroke (109 versus 154; HR: 0.71 [95% CI: 0.55 to 0.90]; P=0.005), total mortality (HR: 0.77 [95% CI: 0.63 to 0.95]; P=0.014), and new-onset diabetes (HR: 0.75 [95% CI: 0.59 to 0.94]; P=0.015) versus the atenolol group, with no between-treatment difference for myocardial infarction (HR: 1.02 [95% CI: 0.74 to 1.39]; P=0.925), cardiovascular mortality (HR: 0.86 [95% CI: 0.64 to 1.14]; P=0.282), or hospitalization for heart failure (HR: 0.94 [95% CI: 0.68 to 1.28]; P=0.677). More women in the losartan group required hospitalization for angina (HR: 1.70 [95% CI: 1.16 to 2.51]; P=0.007). Risk reductions for the primary composite end point, stroke, total mortality, and new-onset diabetes were significantly greater with losartan- versus atenolol-based treatment in women with hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy in the LIFE study. The risk reductions for losartan, along with the tests for the interaction of treatment and gender, indicated that the treatment effect was consistent in men and women for all of the end points tested, with the exception of hospitalization for angina.Short- and long-term survival in treated elderly hypertensive patients with or without diabetes: findings from the Second Australian National Blood Pressure study.We sought to determine the incidence of newly diagnosed diabetes in treated elderly hypertensive patients and the prognostic impact of diabetes on long-term survival.The Second Australian National Blood Pressure (ANBP2) study randomized 6,083 hypertensive patients aged 65-84 years to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) or thiazide diuretic-based therapy and followed them for a median of 4.1 years. Long-term survival was determined in 5,678 patients over an additional median of 6.9 years after ANBP2 (post-trial).After ANBP2, the cohort was classified into preexisting (7.2%), newly diagnosed (5.6%), and no diabetes (87.2%) groups. A 44% higher incidence of newly diagnosed diabetes was observed in patients randomized to thiazide diuretic compared with ACEI-based treatment. The other predictors of newly diagnosed diabetes were having a higher body mass index, having a higher random blood glucose, and living in a regional location compared to major cities (a geographical classification based on accessibility) at study entry. After completion of ANBP2, compared with those with no diabetes, the preexisting diabetes group experienced higher cardiovascular (hazards ratio (HR) = 1.65; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.03-2.65) and all-cause mortality (HR = 1.40; 95% CI = 1.02-1.92) when adjusted for age, sex, and treatment. A similar pattern was observed after including the post-trial period for cardiovascular (HR = 1.52; 95% CI = 1.20-1.93) and all-cause mortality (HR = 1.50; 95% CI = 1.29-1.73). However, when the newly diagnosed group was compared with the no diabetes group, no significant difference was observed in cardiovascular (HR = 0.33; 95% CI = 0.11-1.05) or all-cause mortality (HR = 0.76; 95% CI = 0.47-1.23) either during the ANBP2 trial or including post-trial follow-up (cardiovascular: HR = 0.82; 95% CI = 0.58-1.17; all-cause mortality: HR = 1.04; 95% CI = 0.85-1.27).Long-term presence of diabetes reduces survival. Compared with thiazide diuretics, ACEI-based antihypertensives may delay the development of diabetes in those at risk and thus potentially improve cardiovascular outcome in the elderly.
