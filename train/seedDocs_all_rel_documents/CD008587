Human papillomavirus testing and liquid-based cytology: results at recruitment from the new technologies for cervical cancer randomized controlled trial.Although testing for human papillomavirus (HPV) has higher sensitivity and lower specificity than cytology alone for detecting cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), studies comparing conventional and liquid-based cytology have had conflicting results.In the first phase of a two-phase multicenter randomized controlled trial, women aged 35-60 years in the conventional arm (n = 16,658) were screened using conventional cytology, and women in the experimental arm (n = 16,706) had liquid-based cytology and were tested for high-risk HPV types using the Hybrid Capture 2 assay. Women in the conventional arm were referred to colposcopy with atypical cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS) or higher and those in the experimental arm were referred with ASCUS or higher cytology or with a positive (> or = 1 pg/mL) HPV test. Sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV) for detection of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or higher (CIN2+) were calculated.The screening methods and referral criterion applied in the experimental arm had higher sensitivity than that in the conventional arm (relative sensitivity = 1.47; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.03 to 2.09) but a lower PPV (relative PPV = 0.40; 95% CI = 0.23 to 0.66). With HPV testing alone at > or = 1 pg/mL and at > or = 2 pg/mL, the gain in sensitivity compared with the conventional arm remained similar (relative sensitivity = 1.43, 95% CI = 1.00 to 2.04 and relative sensitivity = 1.41, 95% CI = 0.98 to 2.01, respectively) but PPV progressively improved (relative PPV = 0.58, 95% CI = 0.33 to 0.98 and relative PPV = 0.75, 95% CI = 0.45 and 1.27, respectively). Referral based on liquid-based cytology alone did not increase sensitivity compared with conventional cytology (relative sensitivity = 1.06; 95% CI = 0.72 to 1.55) but reduced PPV (relative PPV = 0.57; 95% CI = 0.39 to 0.82).HPV testing alone was more sensitive than conventional cytology among women 35-60 years old. Adding liquid-based cytology improved sensitivity only marginally but increased false-positives. HPV testing using Hybrid Capture 2 with a 2 pg/mL cutoff may be more appropriate than a 1 pg/mL cutoff for primary cervical cancer screening.High-risk human papilloma virus prevalence and its relation with abnormal cervical cytology among Turkish women.In this study we aimed to investigate high-risk human papilloma virus (hrHPV) prevalence among Turkish women. Cervical samples were collected from 501 women for cytological screening and hrHPV testing by Digene Hybrid Capture 2. hrHPV prevalence and its relation with cytological results and epidemiologic data were analysed by SPSS. The prevalence of hrHPV was 4.2% (21 of the 501 women). Women with abnormal cytological screening results have significantly higher risk of hrHPV positivity compared with women with normal cytological results (19% vs 3.5%) (p ≤ 0.01). The incidence of HPV infection was only associated with the number of sexual partners, but there was no association with age, contraception methods or age at the first sexual intercourse. The prevalence of hrHPV among histological-confirmed cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 1, CIN 2 and normal cases were found as 37.5%, 25% and 25%, respectively. The prevalence of cervical hrHPV infection is 4.2% in our population and this rate seems lower than reported rates from other regions. According to further studies with a larger sample size, reflex cytology based on hrHPV positivity should be considered for our national cervical cancer screening programme.Screening trial of human papillomavirus for early detection of cervical cancer in Santiago, Chile.Cervical cancer mortality in Chile is four times higher than in developed countries. We compared the accuracy of human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA testing and conventional Papanicolaou (Pap) testing to detect prevalent precancerous and cancerous lesions in the routine clinical practice of the public health system. Women aged 25 years and older residing in the area covered by three primary care centers of Santiago, Chile, were invited to participate. Eligible women received both HPV DNA (Hybrid Capture 2) and Pap testing. Women positive by either test (Pap: ASCUS+, HC2: RLU/CO ≥ 1.0) underwent colposcopy and biopsy, as did a sample of double-negative women with an abnormal cervix at visual inspection or with risk factors for cervical lesions. Crude and verification bias-corrected sensitivities and specificities were estimated. In total, 8,265 women (98.8% of eligible) had complete screening results. Of these, 10.7% were HPV positive, 1.7% were Pap positive and 1.1% were positive by both tests. In all, 931 (11.3%) women were screen-positive, of whom 94.3% attended colposcopy. Additionally, 295 control women were invited for colposcopy, of whom 78% attended. In all, 42 CIN2, 45 CIN3 and 9 cancers were identified. Verification bias-corrected sensitivity for CIN2+ (95% confidence interval) was 92.7% (84.4-96.8) for HPV and 22.1% (16.4-29.2) for Pap; corresponding specificities were 92.0% (91.4-92.6) and 98.9% (98.7-99.0). In conclusion, in routine clinical practice in a developing country, HPV testing was four times more sensitive for CIN2+ than Pap testing, identifying three times more CIN2+ lesions; HPV testing was easily implemented in our established cervical cancer prevention program.Shanxi Province cervical cancer screening study II: self-sampling for high-risk human papillomavirus compared to direct sampling for human papillomavirus and liquid based cervical cytology.The objective of this study was to compare the sensitivity and specificity of a new method for self-sampling for high risk human papillomavirus (HPV) with direct sampling and liquid based cervical cytology. In Shanxi Province, China, 8,497 women (ages 27-56) underwent a self-sample for HPV using a conical-shaped brush placed into the upper vagina and rotated. Three to sixteen months later the women were screened with liquid-based cytology and direct HPV tests. Subjects with any abnormal test underwent colposcopy and multiple biopsies. Mean age was 40.9 years. 4.4 percent of subjects had >or=CIN II, 26% a positive self-sample and 24% a positive direct test for HPV. The sensitivity for detection of >or=CIN II was 87.5% for self-sampling, and 96.8% for the direct test (P < 0.001). The specificity was 77.2% for the self-sample and 79.7% for the direct test. With an abnormal Pap defined as ASCUS or greater the sensitivity of the Pap for the detection of >CIN II was 88.3% and the specificity was 81.2%. We conclude that self-sampling for HPV is less sensitive for >CIN II than the direct test, but similar to liquid based cytology.Comparison of HPV-based assays with Papanicolaou smears for cervical cancer screening in Morelos State, Mexico.To compare the performance of human papillomavirus (HPV) assays with conventional Pap cytology for cervical cancer (CC) screening in Mexico.Pap smears, self-collected vaginal specimens (SS) for HPV testing, and clinician-collected cervical specimens (CS) for HPV testing were obtained from 7868 women, aged 15-85 years old, attending CC screening at the Mexican Institute of Social Security (IMSS) between May and October, 1999. SS and CS specimens were screened for oncogenic HPV DNA by Hybrid Capture 2. Women who received cytological interpretations of atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS), and/or a positive HPV test were referred for colposcopy and histologic studies. The relative estimates for sensitivity, specificity and predictive values of each test were calculated using histological diagnoses of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) grades 2 or 3, or CC histological diagnosis.Oncogenic HPV detection rate was 11.6% for SS, and 9.3% for CS. Pap smear abnormalities were observed in 2.4% of the women. Of 1147 women who had at least one abnormal test result, 88.5% underwent colposcopy, and 101 biopsy-confirmed CIN2/3 or cancer cases were identified. The relative sensitivity estimates for the Pap test, SS and CS were 59.4% (95% CI: 49.2-68.9), 71.3% (95% CI: 61.3-79.6), and 93.1% (95% CI: 85.8-96.9), respectively, while the specificities were 98.3% (95% CI: 98.0-98.6), 89.2% (95% CI: 88.5-89.9), and 91.8% (95% CI: 91.2-92.4), respectively. The positive predictive values of Pap, SS and CS were 36.1, 9.1 and 14.9, the colposcopy referrals needed to detect a case of CIN2/3 or cancer were 2.8, 11.0 and 6.7, respectively.Both HPV assays detected more cases of CIN2/3 or CC than Pap cytology alone. However, the HPV assays increased the number of colposcopy referrals. Our study suggests that HPV testing could be an effective way to improve the performance of CC screening.Evaluation of visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA), Lugol's iodine (VILI), cervical cytology and HPV testing as cervical screening tools in Latin America. This report refers to partial results from the LAMS (Latin AMerican Screening) study.To assess the performance indicators of visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA) and visual inspection with Lugol's iodine (VILI) in four Latin American centres participating in the ongoing Latin AMerican Screening (LAMS) study, in settings with moderate incidence of cervical disease and with poorly to moderately well-organized cervical cancer screening.Three Brazilian centres (São Paulo, Campinas and Porto Alegre) and one Argentine centre (Buenos Aires) recruited a total of 11,834 healthy women to undergo VIA, VILI, conventional Pap smear and Hybrid Capture II (HCII).Women who had a positive result from any of these tests were subjected to colposcopy and biopsies (if necessary), and women with high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) were properly treated. To control for verification bias, 5% of women with normal tests were referred for colposcopy, as were 20% of HCII-negative women.Data on VIA (n=11,834), VILI (n=2994), conventional Pap smear (n=10,138) and HCII (n=4195) were available for test comparisons, calculating sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values. Overall test positivity was 11.6% for VIA, 23.0% for VILI, 2.2% for Pap smear (LSIL threshold), 1.1% for Pap smear (HSIL threshold) and 17.1% for HCII. VIA was positive in 61.8% of the women with CIN 1, 57.0% of those with CIN 2, 35.0% of women with CIN 3 and in 21 of 28 (75%) of women with cancer. Approximately 10% of women with no detectable disease had an abnormal VIA. Regarding VILI, 83.3% of women diagnosed with CIN 1 and 62.5% of those with CIN 3 had an abnormal test. VILI failed to detect one of three cases of cancer. Both the sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value of VIA and VILI in detecting CIN 2 or CIN 3 could be significantly improved depending on the combination with Pap smear or HCII (sensitivity up to 100.0% and specificity up to 99.8%).The LAMS study failed to reproduce the performance figures obtained with VIA and VILI (as stand-alone tests) in some other settings, where the prevalence of cervical disease was higher. However, a combined use of VIA or VILI with the Pap test or HCII allowed specific detection of cervical abnormalities.Inclusion of HPV testing in routine cervical cancer screening for women above 29 years in Germany: results for 8466 patients.In a prospective cohort study 8466 women attending routine cervical cancer screening were recruited. Colposcopy was performed on women with any degree of atypia on cytology and/or a positive high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV)-DNA test (HC2; Hybrid Capture 2((c))), and for a randomly selected sample of 3.4% women with negative findings on both. Quality control included reviews of cytology, histology, colposcopy images and retesting of samples with polymerase chain reaction. Test diagnostic performances were based on 7908 women who had complete baseline and follow-up results. Routine histology identified 86 women with high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN2+), which was confirmed by review histology in only 46 cases. Sensitivity of routine cytology for the detection of CIN2+ was 43.5%, with a specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) of 98.0, 11.4 and 99.7%, respectively. Sensitivity of the HC2 test for the detection of CIN2+ was 97.8%, with a specificity, PPV and NPV, of 95.3, 10.9 and 100%, respectively. No high-grade neoplasia was detected in the randomly selected control group. A negative HPV-test result, even in combination with a positive Papanicolaou (Pap) result, virtually excluded any risk of underlying high-grade disease, but this was not the case for a negative Pap result. These data show that HPV testing is of value for the detection or exclusion of prevalent CIN in a routine cervical cancer-screening setting and could be used for further risk classification of women for follow-up management.Risk assessment and clinical impact of liquid-based cytology, oncogenic human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA and mRNA testing in primary cervical cancer screening (the FASE study).New commercial HPV RNA assays require further validation studies in population-based cervical cancer screening settings. To assess the performance of (FDA-approved) APTIMA® HPV Assay (AHPV), Hybrid Capture 2 (HC2), in-house PCR genotyping, and ThinPrep LBC in population-based screening, stratified by three histological gold standards.A multi-center trial in 5006 women undergoing routine screening in France was designed to compare the absolute and relative risks of diagnosing CIN3+ and CIN2+ lesions by different diagnostic tests.Reproducibility between the primary and second pathology reading was excellent for CIN3+ and CIN2+ endpoints (Cohen's kappa 0.948 and 0.854). Absolute risks (PPV) of different tests (AHPV, HC2, PCR genotyping, LBC) in diagnosing CIN2+ (15-20%) and CIN3+ (4-6%) were similar for the first, second, and consensus pathology readings. The relative risks of diagnosing these lesions by the four tests were also similar when the first, second or third pathology readings were employed. AHPV had the highest absolute risk of both histological endpoints, and detects 5% to 15% more CIN3+ and CIN2+ lesions, respectively, than LBC. Compared with HC2 assay, the relative risk of AHPV is 24% to 29% higher, with a significant difference in CIN2+ detection. With LBC as reference, AHPV had the best sensitivity/specificity balance measured by AUC (area under ROC curve) comparison test (significant for CIN2+), and the colposcopy referral rate (9.2%) comparable to that of LBC (8.7%).These data corroborate the suitability of AHPV for the primary cervical cancer screening.Accuracy of human papillomavirus testing in primary screening of cervical neoplasia: results from a multicenter study in India.The knowledge that cervical neoplasia are caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) infection has led to the evaluation of its role in screening. We evaluated the accuracy of HPV testing by Hybrid capture II (HC II) method in detecting cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 and 3 (CIN 2 and 3) lesions in 4 cross-sectional studies with common protocol and questionnaire in 3 different locations (Kolkata, Mumbai and Trivandrum) in India. These studies involved 18,085 women aged 25-65 years. The reference standard for final diagnosis was a combination of colposcopy/biopsy. All women were investigated with colposcopy and 3,116 received directed biopsy. The sensitivity of HPV testing for detecting CIN 2-3 lesions varied from 45.7% to 80.9% across the study sites; the specificity varied from 91.7% to 94.6% and the positive predictive value from 6.7% to 13.7%. Retesting of 298 randomly chosen denatured samples in France revealed an agreement rate of 85.9% and a kappa-value of 0.72. Although HPV testing seems to be a promising approach for cervical cancer prevention, a large range in sensitivity was observed in our study, possibly due to variations in the quality of specimen collection and reference standards. A higher sensitivity was associated with the center performing the test well. Further developments in terms of more reproducible, less expensive and less sophisticated testing are essential to make the test feasible and effective in low-resource settings.CareHPV cervical cancer screening demonstration in a rural population of north India.To compare cervical careHPV screening in a rural community setting with other methods of cervical screening for the detection of high-grade cervical intra-epithelial neoplasia (CIN).Cross-sectional study. All ever-married women aged 30-59 years surveyed in an administrative area of Uttar Pradesh, India were targeted for screening by careHPV (cervical and vaginal samples), Pap test and visual inspection of the cervix following application of acetic acid (VIA). Women who screened positive were referred for colposcopy and the results were confirmed histologically. Sensitivity, specificity and predictive values for the detection of histological CINII+ and CINIII+ were assessed for each screening test.Sixty-five percent (5032/7704) of the women invited for cervical screening agreed to participate in the study. Screen-positive rates for cervical careHPV, vaginal careHPV, Pap test and VIA were 3%, 2%, 3% and 6%, respectively. Data for women who did not complete all screening modes, women lost to follow-up and women with missing histological results were excluded before data analysis, resulting in a final sample size of 4658. Cervical careHPV had high sensitivity (85%) for the detection of CINIII+ lesions and moderate sensitivity (53%) for the detection of CINII+ lesions. Sensitivities for the detection of CINIII+ and CINII+ were 54% and 41% for vaginal careHPV, 62% and 44% for Pap test, and 8% and 22% for VIA, respectively.Cervical careHPV testing is superior to VIA and Pap test for the detection of high-grade CIN in a rural community setting.Screening for high-grade cervical intra-epithelial neoplasia and cancer by testing for high-risk HPV, routine cytology or colposcopy.The validity of testing for high-risk types of human papillomavirus (HPV) in cervical cancer prevention programs is undetermined. We compared the performance on primary screening of HPV DNA testing, cytology and colposcopy in detecting cervical intra-epithelial neoplasia (CIN) grade 2 or 3 or cancer. A cohort of 4,761 women, median age 35 years, was screened by routine cytology, routine colposcopy and testing for high-risk HPV by a PCR-based method. Within an 8-month period, women with abnormal findings on cytology or screening colposcopy or in whom high-risk HPV types were detected were referred for colposcopy and biopsy. Women negative on all initial screening tests were followed by a second screening examination. To correct for work-up bias, the true prevalence of CIN 2 or 3 or cancer was estimated by projection from histologically verified subgroups. Cervical biopsies were taken in 364 women (7.6%), of whom 114 (2.4%) showed CIN 2 (n = 34) or CIN 3 (n = 71) or cancer (n = 9). High-risk HPV testing achieved bias-corrected performance measures of 89.4% sensitivity, 93.9% specificity, 35.8% positive predictive value and 99.6% negative predictive value. Bias-corrected rates of true- and false-positives by high-risk HPV testing compared to cytology (colposcopy) were about 4.5 (6.7) and 19.1 (7.4) times higher, respectively. The quality of routine cytology was controlled by computer-assisted review, and the observed number of true-positives more than doubled after adding automated review results. In middle-aged women, testing for high-risk HPV types, particularly when negative, may be used to increase the screening interval in programs for secondary prevention of cervical cancer.Human papillomavirus messenger RNA assay for cervical cancer screening: the Shenzhen Cervical Cancer Screening Trial I.Testing for high-risk types of human papillomavirus (HPV) has been consistently more sensitive than cervical cytology for high-grade precancers and cancers of the cervix (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or higher) but less specific. New assays are being developed to improve on the overall accuracy of molecular testing. The Gen-Probe APTIMA HPV assay (AHPV) is a multiplex assay that qualitatively detects 14 HPV types in a single tube. Because the AHPV targets HPV-E6/E7 messenger RNA transcripts, it should theoretically have a greater specificity than HPV assays that detect HPV DNA. The objective of this study was to compare the sensitivity and the specificity of the Gen-Probe AHPV with those of the Qiagen Hybrid Capture 2 assay (HC2) and liquid-based cytologic examination for cervical cancer screening.A total of 2098 unscreened or poorly screened women 25 to 59 years of age were recruited in the city of Shenzhen, China. Two cervical specimens were collected: 1 in SurePath liquid for cytologic examination and 1 in PreservCyt for HPV testing by HC2 and the AHPV. The testing was performed by blinded technicians according to the manufacturer's instructions. Women who had atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance or worse cytologic diagnosis and/or were HPV positive by either assay were asked to return for colposcopy and biopsy.Overall, 2095 women had complete data. Overall, 16.5% of the women were positive on HC2, 10.1% were positive on the AHPV, 5.45% had atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance or greater on cytologic examination, and 1.4% had histologically confirmed cervical disease: cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or higher. The sensitivity values of liquid-based cytologic examination, HC2, and the AHPV were 66.7%, 88.9%, and 100%, respectively. The specificity values were 95.5%, 84.5%, and 91.2%, respectively. The AHPV was significantly more accurate by receiver operating characteristic curve comparison (P = 0.005).The low false-positive rate (high specificity) and the high sensitivity of the AHPV makes this assay suitable for use as a primary assay for detecting cervical disease in a screening setting.The study of the combination detection of HPV-DNA and p16INK4a in cervical lesions.The objective of this study is to detect the infection of human papillomavirus (HPV) and the expression of p16(INK4a) in cervical lesions and to investigate the interaction between hrHPV and p16(INK4a) for cervical lesions and its diagnostic efficiency. hrHPV-DNA was detected by the hybrid capture II (HC-II) system. Immunochemical method was used to detect the expression of p16(INK4a), and histopathologic test was performed to identify cervical lesions. χ(2) test and Spearman's rank correlation were used for statistical analysis. Additive effects model was used to analyze the interaction. The diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive values, negative predictive values, accuracy, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve were calculated with SPSS 13.0. hrHPV and p16(INK4a) positive rate increased (P < 0.05) with histopathologic diagnosis increasing. The positive rates of hrHPV and p16(INK4a) in negative or chronic inflammation were statistically lower than that in cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN)1, CIN2, CIN3, and squamous-cell carcinoma (SCC) (P < 0.05), respectively. There was a positive interaction between hrHPV and p16(INK4a), relative excess risk of interaction (RERI) was 52.49, attributable proportions of interaction (API) were 72.34%, and the synergy index (S) was 3.75. The specificity and AUC of combining hrHPV with p16(INK4a) were statistically higher than hrHPV or p16(INK4a) alone (P < 0.05). hrHPV and p16(INK4a) are useful markers for the early diagnosis of cervical lesions. A positive interaction between hrHPV and p16(INK4a) is seen. The combination of hrHPV and p16(INK4a) has a higher diagnostic accuracy than hrHPV or p16(INK4a) alone in diagnosis of cervical lesions.Human papillomavirus testing for primary screening in women at low risk of developing cervical cancer. The Greek experience.To compare the performance of human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA detection against routine Papanicolaou smear for the detection of low- and high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia in a low-risk population.A cross-sectional study was performed involving 1296 women attending six outpatient clinics in Northern Greece (Thessaloniki, Thermi, Mihaniona, Corfu, Veria, and Serres). Women underwent a gynecological examination, including collection of exfoliated cervical cells for Papanicolaou cytology and HPV DNA detection. Cytology was processed according the conventional routine manner, and HPV DNA was determined using the polymerase chain reaction technique. In positive cases of either method, a complete colposcopic evaluation was performed with directed biopsies. Tests (HPV DNA, cytology, and colposcopy) performance characteristics were determined using the histopathologic diagnosis as the reference standard.HPV DNA testing showed a significantly better sensitivity than the Papanicolaou smear in detecting cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (75% versus 50% for high-grade lesions and 81.2% versus 50% for lesions of any grade, respectively). Specificity, and positive and negative predictive values did not significantly differ. Even after dividing women in younger or older than 30 years, the sensitivity of the HPV DNA test was greater than cytology (100% and 70% versus 50% for cytology in both groups, respectively), with a 6.3% loss in specificity when performed in women younger than 30 years.HPV testing could be useful in screening women at low risk for cervical cancer, either as an adjunct tool to augment existing cytology programs or as a unique test of its own.Prior knowledge of HPV status improves detection of CIN2+ by cytology screening.The objective of the study was to investigate whether knowledge of human papillomavirus (HPV) deoxyribonucleic acid test results increases sensitivity of guided cytology screening for the detection of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN)-2 or higher-grade cervical lesions.This was a prospective colposcopy-controlled study of 2905 BD SurePath samples to identify cases with CIN2+ within a 24 month follow-up period. Sensitivity and specificity to detect CIN2+ was evaluated, comparing guided cytology screening with and without prior knowledge of HPV status.Prior knowledge of HPV status resulted in significantly higher detection rate of CIN2+ compared with screening blinded to HPV status (P = .005) with limited loss of specificity (P = .026). Gain in sensitivity is higher in older women (43.8%, P = .008) vs in younger women (10.2%, P = .317), whereas loss of specificity is more pronounced in younger women (P < .001) vs older women (P = .729).Guided cytological screening performed with prior knowledge of HPV status results in an improved detection of CIN2 or higher-grade lesions.Performance of carcinogenic human papillomavirus (HPV) testing and HPV16 or HPV18 genotyping for cervical cancer screening of women aged 25 years and older: a subanalysis of the ATHENA study.The ATHENA study was designed to assess the performance of carcinogenic human papillomavirus (HPV) testing and HPV16 or HPV18 genotyping compared with liquid-based cytology for cervical cancer screening in a large US population aged 21 years and older. We did a subanalysis of this population to compare the screening performance of the cobas HPV test versus liquid-based cytology in women aged 25 years and older, and assess management strategies for HPV-positive women.Women aged 25 years or older who were attending routine cervical screening were enrolled from 61 clinical centres in 23 US states. Cervical specimens were obtained for liquid-based cytology and HPV DNA testing with two first-generation assays (Amplicor HPV test and Linear Array HPV genotyping test) and the second-generation cobas HPV test (with individual HPV16 and HPV18 detection). Colposcopy and diagnostic biopsies were done on women with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US) or worse cytology, those who tested positive with either first-generation HPV test, and a random sample of women who tested negative for HPV and cytology. All women not selected for colposcopy received their results and exited the study. Participants and colposcopists were masked to cytology and HPV test results until the colposcopy visit was completed. The primary endpoint for this substudy was histologically confirmed cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 (CIN3) or worse. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00709891; the study is in the follow-up phase, which is due to be completed in December, 2012.From May 27, 2008, to Aug 27, 2009, 47,208 women were enrolled, of whom 41,955 met our eligibility criteria. Valid cobas HPV and liquid-based cytology test results were available for 40,901 women (97%), who were included in this analysis. Of these, 4275 women (10%) tested cobas HPV positive and 2617 (6%) had abnormal cytology. 431 women were diagnosed with CIN2 or worse and 274 with CIN3 or worse. In women who had colposcopy, the cobas HPV test was more sensitive than liquid-based cytology for detection of CIN3 or worse (252/274 [92·0%, 95% CI 88·1-94·6] vs 146/274 [53·3%, 95% CI 47·4-59·1]; difference 38·7%, 95% CI 31·9-45·5; p<0·0001). Addition of liquid-based cytology to HPV testing increased sensitivity for CIN3 or worse to 96·7% (265/274, 95% CI 93·9-98·3), but increased the number of screen positives by 35·2% (5783/40,901 vs 4275/40,901) compared with HPV testing alone. As a triage test to identify CIN3 or worse in HPV-positive women, detection of HPV16, HPV18, or both alone was equivalent to detection of ASC-US or worse alone in terms of sensitivity (150/252 [59·5%] vs 133/252 [52·8%]; p=0·11) and positive predictive value (PPV) (150/966 [15·5%] vs 133/940 [14·1%]; p=0·20). Among HPV-positive women, detection of HPV16, HPV18, or both or low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion or worse cytology had better sensitivity (182/252 [72·2%]; p<0·0001) and similar PPV (182/1314 [13·9%]; p=0·70) for detection of CIN3 or worse than ASC-US or worse cytology alone. Furthermore, detection of HPV16, HPV18, or both or high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion or worse cytology had higher sensitivity (165/252 [65·5%]; p=0·0011) and PPV (165/1013 [16·3%]; p=0·031) for detection of CIN3 or worse than ASC-US or worse cytology alone.HPV testing with separate HPV16 and HPV18 detection could provide an alternative, more sensitive, and efficient strategy for cervical cancer screening than do methods based solely on cytology.Roche Molecular Systems.HPV testing in primary screening of older women.Certain types of the human papilloma virus (HPV) are well established as the primary cause of cervical cancer. Several studies have shown that HPV testing can improve the detection rate of high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), but these have been carried out primarily in younger women. In this study we evaluated the role of HPV testing as an adjunct to cytology in women aged 35 or over. An additional aim was to evaluate commercially available kits for HPV testing. A total of 2988 eligible women aged 34 or more attending for a routine smear in 40 general practitioner practices received HPV testing in addition to routine cytology, after having given written informed consent. Samples were assayed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and two versions of the Hybrid Capture test for HPV, and women were invited for colposcopy if there was any cytological abnormality (including borderline smears) or the PCR test was positive. Any apparent abnormality was biopsied and loop-excision was performed as necessary. CIN was judged by histology; 42 women had high-grade CIN, of which six were cytology negative (86% sensitivity for borderline or worse) and three had a borderline smear (79% sensitivity for mild dyskaryosis or worse). The positive predictive value of a borderline smear was only 3.1%. Eleven high-grade lesions were negative by the PCR HPV test (sensitivity 74%). The first generation Hybrid Capture II test had a similar sensitivity but an unacceptably high false positive rate (18.3%), while the newer Hybrid Capture II microtitre kit had a 95% sensitivity and a 2.3% positivity rate in normal women when used at a 2 pg ml(-1) cut-off (positive predictive value 27%). Cytology performed very well in this older cohort of women. The newer Hybrid Capture II microtitre test may be a useful adjunct, especially if the results reported here are reproducible in other studies. A combined screening test offers the possibility of greater protection and/or longer screening intervals, which could reduce the overall cost of the screening programme.Impact of improved classification on the association of human papillomavirus with cervical precancer.Misclassification of exposure and surrogate endpoints of disease can obscure causal relations. Using data from the Atypical Squamous Cells of Undetermined Significance/Low-Grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesion Triage Study (ALTS, 1997-2001), the authors explored the impact of exposure (human papillomavirus (HPV) detection) and endpoint (histologic cervical precancer) classification on their mutual association. Women referred into this study with an atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance Papanicolaou test with satisfactory results for all 4 HPV tests were included in this analysis (n = 3,215; 92.2%). HPV testing results were related to different definitions of cervical precancer, based on paired, worst 2-year histologic diagnoses, by calculating clinical sensitivity, specificity, and odds ratios. The authors found that HPV test sensitivity increased and specificity decreased with increasing certainty of cervical precancer, with HPV testing having the highest sensitivity (92%-98%) and lowest specificity (46%-54%) for consensus cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 (CIN 3). The overall accuracy of each HPV test, as measured by odds ratios, was greatest for consensus CIN-3 diagnoses, from 2- to 4-fold greater than for a less stringent precancer definition of any diagnosis of CIN 2 or more severe. In summary, there was convergence of greater certainty of carcinogenic HPV with greater certainty of a precancerous diagnosis, such that all 4 HPV tests almost always tested positive in women most likely to have cervical precancer. Finding increasingly strong associations when both test and diagnostic misclassification are reduced is a useful sign of "true association" in molecular epidemiology.Significance of high-risk human papillomavirus detection by polymerase chain reaction in primary cervical cancer screening.The purposes of this study were to evaluate the incidence of high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) infection by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and to assess its diagnostic usefulness in primary cervical screening. PCR testing for HPV type 16, 18, 31 and 33 was performed on 1305 specimens obtained during routine cervical cancer screening. We analysed the concurrent cervical smears and biopsy, and correlated them with the HPV infection status. We also evaluated histologically-proven cases with ASCUS smears according to HPV infection. HPV DNA was identified in eight (0.7%) of 1144 cytologically normal patients; nine (10.5%) of 86 ASCUS; seven (25.0%) of 28 LSIL; 26 (78.8%) of 33 HSIL; and in all of three squamous cell carcinomas (SCC). HPV positivity was significantly associated with cytohistological diagnosis for HSIL of more. In addition, HPV-positive ASCUS cases were found to be associated with histological abnormality rather than HPV-negative. The results indicate that high-risk HPV testing by PCR could be a useful adjunct tool for Pap smear in primary cervical screening. The combination of Pap smear and high-risk HPV testing by PCR might reduce unnecessary colposcopy-guided biopsy of women with cytological diagnosis of ASCUS.Performance of high-risk human papillomavirus DNA testing as a primary screen for cervical cancer: a pooled analysis of individual patient data from 17 population-based studies from China.Controversy remains over whether high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA testing should be used as a primary screen for cervical cancer. The aims of our study were to assess whether HPV DNA testing could be applied to cervical-cancer screening programmes in China, as well as other similar developing countries.We did a pooled analysis of population-based cervical cancer screening studies done in mainland China from 1999 to 2008 with concurrent HPV DNA testing (Hybrid Capture 2 assay; Qiagen, Gaithersburg, MD, USA), liquid-based cytology (LBC), and visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA). Eligible women were sexually active, not pregnant, had an intact uterus, and had no history of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), cervical cancer, or pelvic irradiation. All women positive for any test were referred for colposcopy and biopsy. Cervical lesions were diagnosed by directed or random biopsy. We assessed the diagnostic accuracy of HPV DNA testing for the detection of CIN grade 3 or greater.30,371 women from 17 cross-sectional, population-based studies in various parts of China were screened. 1523 women were subsequently excluded because of inadequate HPV DNA specimens or they did not have a biopsy taken, which included women with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance; low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion or worse; positive HPV, negative cytology, and missing or positive colposcopy results; and unsatisfactory cytology results. HPV DNA testing had a higher sensitivity of 97·5% (95% CI 95·7-98·7) for detection of CIN grade 3 or worse, and a lower specificity of 85·1% (82·3-87·9), compared with cytology (sensitivity 87·9% [95% CI 84·7-90·7], specificity 94·7% [93·5-96·0]) and VIA (54·6% [48·0-61·2], 89·9% [86·8-93·0]). Sensitivity did not vary by study or age (<35 years, 35-49 years, ≥50 years); however, specificity did vary with age (p<0·0001) and was highest in women younger than 35 years (89·4%; 95% CI 86·1-91·5). An increase in the positive cutoff point from the manufacturer recommended 1 pg/mL to 2 pg/mL led to a decrease in the overall HPV DNA positivity from 16·3% to 13·9% (p<0·0001), which could result in a decrease in referral rates, although sensitivity was slightly lower (97·5% to 95·2%). An increase in the cutoff point to 10 pg/mL in women younger than 35 years maintained a high sensitivity 97·7% (95% CI 87·7-99·9) and increased specificity to 93·5% (95% CI 91·9-94·6).HPV DNA testing is highly sensitive and moderately specific for CIN grade 3 or worse, with consistent results across study sites and age groups-including women younger than 35 years. A rise in the cutoff point might be beneficial for future screening programmes in China, especially when screening women younger than 35 years.Management of women who test positive for high-risk types of human papillomavirus: the HART study.Certain types of human papillomavirus (HPV) are the primary cause of almost all cervical cancers. HPV testing of cervical smears is more sensitive but less specific than cytology for detecting high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN2+). HPV testing as a primary screening approach requires efficient management of HPV-positive women with negative or borderline cytology. We aimed to compare the detection rate and positive predictive values of HPV assay with cytology and to determine the best management strategy for HPV-positive women.We did a multicentre screening study of 11085 women aged 30-60 years. Women with borderline cytology and women positive for high-risk HPV with negative cytology were randomised to immediate colposcopy or to surveillance by repeat HPV testing, cytology, and colposcopy at 12 months.HPV testing was more sensitive than borderline or worse cytology (97.1% vs 76.6%, p=0.002) but less specific (93.3% vs 95.8%, p<0.0001) for detecting CIN2+. Of 825 randomised women, surveillance at 12 months was as effective as immediate colposcopy. In women positive for HPV at baseline, who had surveillance, 73 (45%) of 164 women with negative cytology and eight (35%) of 23 women with borderline cytology were HPV negative at 6-12 months. No CIN2+ was found in these women, nor in women with an initial negative HPV test with borderline (n=211) or mild (32) cytology.HPV testing could be used for primary screening in women older than 30 years, with cytology used to triage HPV-positive women. HPV-positive women with normal or borderline cytology (about 6% of screened women) could be managed by repeat testing after 12 months. This approach could potentially improve detection rates of CIN2+ without increasing the colposcopy referral rate.Application of human papillomavirus in screening for cervical cancer and precancerous lesions.Cervical cancer is a commonly-encountered malignant tumor in women. Cervical screening is particularly important due to early symptoms being deficient in specificity. The main purpose of the study is to assess the application value of cervical thinprep cytologic test (TCT) and human papillomavirus (HPV) detection in screening for cervical cancer and precancerous lesions. In the study, cervical TCT and HPV detection were simultaneously performed on 12,500 patients selected in a gynecological clinic. Three hundred patients with positive results demonstrated by cervical TCT and/or HPV detection underwent cervical tissue biopsy under colposcopy, and pathological results were considered as the gold standard. The results revealed that 200 out of 12,500 patients were abnormal by TCT, in which 30 cases pertained to equivocal atypical squamous cells (ASCUS), 80 cases to low squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL), 70 cases to high squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) and 20 cases to squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). With increasing pathological grade of cervical biopsy, however, TCT positive rates did not rise. Two hundred and eighty out of 12,500 patients were detected as positive for HPV infection, in which 50 cases were chronic cervicitis and squamous metaplasia, 70 cases cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) I, 60 cases CIN II, 70 cases CIN III and 30 cases invasive cervical carcinoma. Two hundred and thirty patients with high-risk HPV infection were detected. With increase in pathological grade, the positive rate of high-risk HPV also rose. The detection rates of HPV detection to CIN III and invasive cervical carcinoma as well as the total detection rate of lesions were significantly higher than that of TCT. Hence, HPV detection is a better method for screening of cervical cancer at present. Comparison of pap smear, visual inspection with acetic acid, human papillomavirus DNA-PCR testing and cervicography.To assess the test qualities of four screening methods to detect cervical intra-epithelial neoplasia in an urban African setting.Six hundred fifty-three women, attending a family planning clinic in Nairobi (Kenya), underwent four concurrent screening methods: pap smear, visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA), PCR for high risk human papillomavirus (HR HPV) and cervicography. The presence of cervical intra-epithelial neoplasia (CIN) was verified by colposcopy or biopsy.Sensitivity (for CIN2 or higher) and specificity (to exclude any CIN or cancer) were 83.3% (95% CI [73.6, 93.0]) and 94.6% (95% CI [92.6, 96.5]), respectively, for pap smear; 73.3% (95% CI [61.8, 84.9]) and 80.0% (95% CI [76.6, 83.4]) for VIA; 94.4% (95% CI [84.6, 98.8]) and 73.9% (95% CI [69.7, 78.2]) for HR HPV; and 72.3% (95% CI [59.1, 85.6]) and 93.2% (95% CI [90.8, 95.7]) for cervicography.The pap smear had the highest specificity (94.6%) and HPV testing the highest sensitivity (94.4%). The visual methods, VIA and cervicography, were similar and showed an accuracy in between the former two tests.Prevalence of high-risk human papillomavirus types and cervical squamous intraepithelial lesions in women over 30 years of age in St. Petersburg, Russia.Cytology-based screening has significantly decreased incidence of and mortality from cervical cancer. High sensitivity of high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) test for the detection of high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) makes it a useful screening tool, especially in settings where cytology is not available or not quality assured. The study aimed to determine the prevalence of hrHPV and associated cervical lesions in Russian women over 30 years of age and to assess usefulness of HPV test for cervical screening in Russia.Consecutive women aged 30-65 years (n=823) receiving routine gynaecological care, not pregnant and not treated for high-grade CIN, were recruited. Oncogenic HPV types were detected using Hybrid Capture 2 (HC2) assay and genotyped with direct DNA sequencing. Women with cytological abnormalities higher than atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS) and women positive for hrHPV were referred to colposcopy.HPV infection was present in 107 (13%) women. Cytological abnormalities were found in 81 (9.8%) patients, including 59 (7.2%) with ASCUS, 21 (2.5%) with low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL), and one (0.1%) with high-grade SIL. Only 11 (18.6%) patients with ASCUS were positive for hrHPV. Histological diagnoses were obtained for 63 women. Relative sensitivities and positive predictive values of the HPV test and cytology for the detection of high-grade CIN were 100% (6/6) and 9.5% (6/63), and 83.3% (5/6) and 27.8% (5/18), respectively. The most prevalent hrHPV types were 16 (3.9%), 31 (2.8%), 52 (1.7%), and 33 (1.3%). Cytological abnormalities and symptoms of a urogenital infection were strongly associated with hrHPV infection.The study provides data on the prevalence of hrHPV types in association with cervical lesions, as well as on hrHPV determinants, in an unvaccinated population of Russian women. Our results indicate that HPV test might be a useful screening tool in Russia.Head-to-Head Comparison of the RNA-Based Aptima Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Assay and the DNA-Based Hybrid Capture 2 HPV Test in a Routine Screening Population of Women Aged 30 to 60 Years in Germany.Testing for E6/E7 mRNA in cells infected with high-risk (HR) human papillomavirus (HPV) might improve the specificity of HPV testing for the identification of cervical precancerous lesions. Here we compared the RNA-based Aptima HPV (AHPV) assay (Hologic) and the DNA-based Hybrid Capture 2 (HC2) HPV test (Qiagen) to liquid-based cytology (LBC) for women undergoing routine cervical screening. A total of 10,040 women, 30 to 60 years of age, were invited to participate in the study, 9,451 of whom were included in the analysis. Specimens were tested centrally by LBC, the AHPV test, and the HC2 test, and women who tested positive on any test were referred for colposcopy. Genotyping was performed on all HR-HPV-positive samples. Test characteristics were calculated based on histological review. As a result, we identified 90 women with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2+ (CIN2+), including 43 women with CIN3+. Sensitivity differences between the AHPV test and the HC2 test in detecting CIN2+ (P = 0.180) or CIN3+ (P = 0.0625) lesions were statistically nonsignificant. Of three CIN3 cases that were missed with the AHPV test, two cases presented lesion-free cones and one had a non-HR HPV67 infection. The specificity (<CIN2) and positive predictive value (CIN2+) of the AHPV test were significantly higher (both P < 0.001) than those of the HC2 test. The overall agreement between the tests was substantial (κ = 0.77). Finally, we present results for several possible triage strategies, based on the primary screening test being either the AHPV test or the HC2 test. In summary, the AHPV assay is both specific and sensitive for the detection of high-grade precancerous lesions and may be used in primary cervical cancer screening for women ≥30 years of age. Quantification of intracellular HPV E6/E7 mRNA expression increases the specificity and positive predictive value of cervical cancer screening compared to HPV DNA.Current methods for HPV screening rely on the detection of L1 DNA from high risk genotypes (HRHPV). These assays have very high negative predictive values (~99%), however, the specificity and positive predictive value of HPV DNA tests for pre-cancerous and cancerous lesions (CIN 2+) is less than 50%. The purpose of this study was to compare HPV DNA with intracellular HPV E6, E7 mRNA quantification in an effort to improve the performance of cervical cancer screening.Liquid-based cervical cytology specimens collected in either PreservCyt or SurePath were processed for routing cytology, HPV HRDNA detection by Hybrid Capture 2 and HPV E6, E7 mRNA quantification in cells using the same sample. We analyzed a total of 2049 samples including 73 with CIN 2, CIN 3, or squamous cell carcinoma by biopsy and 1694 samples from women with normal cytology.The positive predictive value of HPV E6, E7 mRNA quantification in cells for CIN2+ was 78% which was greater than HPV DNA alone (43%). The specificity of HPV E6, E7 mRNA quantification was 96% based on normal cytology compared to 82% for HC2 while the specificity of HPV E6, E7 mRNA quantification based on CIN 2- histology was 85% compared to 35% for HC2.With similar sensitivity and greater specificity/positive predictive value, HPV E6, E7 mRNA quantification in cells is an improvement over HPV DNA for cervical cancer screening.A population-based study on the risks of cervical lesion and human papillomavirus infection among women in Beijing, People's Republic of China.Few population-based studies have investigated premalignant and malignant cervical abnormalities in Beijing.A total of 6,385 randomly selected sexually active women were interviewed and examined. Cervical lesion was diagnosed using cytology and histology. High-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) was detected by the second-generation hybrid capture test and typed by gene chip of DNA from paraffin-embedded tissue.The cervical lesion prevalence diagnosed by histology was 5.8%. High-risk HPV overall prevalence was 9.9%, 50.5% with cervical lesion and 7.4% without cervical lesion. High-risk HPV DNA load increased with increasing degree of lesions. HPV 16 was the most common type (26.5%) among women with cervical lesion, followed by HPV 58 (8.8%), HPV 33 (7.8%), and HPV 56 (5.3%). Women under 50 years of age, married status, pregnancy and delivery status, couple's sexual behavior, contraceptive history, columnar ectopy, and bacterial vaginosis or trichomonas vaginitis history were more risk factors for HPV infection. Factors for cervical lesion were similar, but in comparison with HPV infection, all associations were weakened. Only middle-aged women, husband's sexual partners, oral contraceptives, columnar ectopy, and history of trichomonas vaginitis remained associated with cervical lesion.In Beijing, the prevalence of cervical lesion and high-risk HPV is higher than estimated in previous reports. HPV 16, 58, and 33 were the most prevalent types. This is relevant for work related to cervical cancer vaccination.The study was conducted to understand the current status and epidemiologic characteristics of women with cervical lesion and HPV infection in Beijing.Cervical cancer risk for women undergoing concurrent testing for human papillomavirus and cervical cytology: a population-based study in routine clinical practice.Concurrent testing for human papillomavirus (HPV) and cervical cytology (co-testing) is an approved alternative to cytology alone in women aged 30 years and older. We aimed to assess the safety in routine clinical practice of 3-year screening intervals for women testing negative for HPV with normal cytology and to assess if co-testing can identify women at high risk of cervical cancer or cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 (CIN3) or worse over 5 years.We assessed the 5-year cumulative incidence, starting in 2003-05, of cervical cancer and CIN3 or worse for 331,818 women aged 30 years and older who enrolled in co-testing at Kaiser Permanente Northern California (Berkeley, CA, USA) and had adequate enrolment co-test results. Follow-up continued until Dec 31, 2009. We defined cumulative incidence to include prevalence at enrolment and incidence after enrolment. Prevalence at enrolment was defined as the ratio of women diagnosed with each outcome on the biopsy visit immediately after their enrolment screening visit to the total enrolled women. At screening visits only HPV test and Pap smear samples were collected, and at biopsy visits colposcopically directed biopsies were taken. To estimate post-enrolment incidence, we used Weibull survival models.In 315,061 women negative by HPV testing, the 5-year cumulative incidence of cancer was 3.8 per 100,000 women per year, slightly higher than for the 306,969 who were both negative by HPV and Pap testing (3.2 per 100,000), and half the cancer risk of the 319,177 who were negative by Pap testing (7.5 per 100,000). 313,465 (99.5%) women negative by HPV testing had either normal cytology or equivocal abnormalities. Abnormal cytology greatly increased cumulative incidence of CIN3 or worse over 5 years for the 16,757 positive by HPV testing (12.1%vs 5.9%; p<0.0001). By contrast, although statistically significant, abnormal cytology did not increase 5-year risk of CIN3 or worse for women negative by HPV testing to a substantial level (0.86%vs 0.16%; p=0.004). 12,208 (73%) of the women positive by HPV testing had no cytological abnormality, and these women had 258 (35%) of 747 CIN3 or adenocarcinoma in situ, [corrected] 25 (29%) of 87 cancers, and 17 (63%) of 27 adenocarcinomas.For women aged 30 years and older in routine clinical practice who are negative by co-testing (both HPV and cytology), 3-year screening intervals were safe because a single negative test for HPV was sufficient to reassure against cervical cancer over 5 years. Incorporating HPV testing with cytology also resulted in earlier identification of women at high risk of cervical cancer, especially adenocarcinoma. Testing for HPV without adjunctive cytology might be sufficiently sensitive for primary screening for cervical cancer.Intramural Research Program of the US National Cancer Institute/NIH/DHHS, and the American Cancer Society.Efficacy of HPV DNA testing with cytology triage and/or repeat HPV DNA testing in primary cervical cancer screening.Primary cervical screening with both human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA testing and cytological examination of cervical cells with a Pap test (cytology) has been evaluated in randomized clinical trials. Because the vast majority of women with positive cytology are also HPV DNA positive, screening strategies that use HPV DNA testing as the primary screening test may be more effective.We used the database from the intervention arm (n = 6,257 women) of a population-based randomized trial of double screening with cytology and HPV DNA testing to evaluate the efficacy of 11 possible cervical screening strategies that are based on HPV DNA testing alone, cytology alone, and HPV DNA testing combined with cytology among women aged 32-38 years. The main outcome measures were sensitivity for detection of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 or worse (CIN3+) within 6 months of enrollment or at colposcopy for women with a persistent type-specific HPV infection and the number of screening tests and positive predictive value (PPV) for each screening strategy. All statistical tests were two-sided.Compared with screening by cytology alone, double testing with cytology and for type-specific HPV persistence resulted in a 35% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 15% to 60%) increase in sensitivity to detect CIN3+, without a statistically significant reduction in the PPV (relative PPV = 0.76, 95% CI = 0.52 to 1.10), but with more than twice as many screening tests needed. Several strategies that incorporated screening for high-risk HPV subtypes were explored, but they resulted in reduced PPV compared with cytology. Compared with cytology, primary screening with HPV DNA testing followed by cytological triage and repeat HPV DNA testing of HPV DNA-positive women with normal cytology increased the CIN3+ sensitivity by 30% (95% CI = 9% to 54%), maintained a high PPV (relative PPV = 0.87, 95% CI = 0.60 to 1.26), and resulted in a mere 12% increase in the number of screening tests (from 6,257 to 7,019 tests).Primary HPV DNA-based screening with cytology triage and repeat HPV DNA testing of cytology-negative women appears to be the most feasible cervical screening strategy.Human papillomavirus (HPV) detection using in situ hybridization in histologic samples: correlations with cytologic changes and polymerase chain reaction HPV detection.Although in situ hybridization (ISH) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) have extensively been used on cytology specimens, there have been limited reports of the usefulness of these techniques in relation to confirmed histologic findings. In this study, we used PCR and ISH to detect human papillomavirus (HPV) in cytologic and histologic specimens, respectively. By using positive and negative likelihood ratios, we attempted to identify any predictive role of ISH testing alone or in combination with PCR for the development of high-grade histologic lesions (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia [CIN] 2+). In our study, ISH was a useful method for detection of HPV, even in a large fraction of samples with normal cytologic or biopsy findings. We suggest that when used together and evaluated in conjunction with histologic sections, ISH is a useful tool for ancillary molecular testing of HPV infection in cervical lesions, especially in CIN 2+ histological lesions where its analytic sensitivities and specificities were as good as those of PCR testing.Concurrent evaluation of visual, cytological and HPV testing as screening methods for the early detection of cervical neoplasia in Mumbai, India.Naked eye visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA), magnified VIA (VIAM), visual inspection with Lugol's iodine (VILI), cytology and human papillomavirus (HPV) testing were evaluated as screening methods for the detection of high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL) of the uterine cervix in a cross-sectional study in Mumbai, India.Cytology, HPV testing, VIA, VIAM and VILI were carried out concurrently for 4039 women aged 30-65 years. All women were investigated with colposcopy and biopsies were taken from 939 women who had colposcopic abnormalities. The reference standard for final disease status was histology or negative colposcopy. The presence of HSIL was confirmed in 57 women (1.4%). The test characteristics for each method were calculated using standard formulae.The sensitivities of cytology, HPV testing, VIA, VIAM and VILI were 57.4%, 62.0%, 59.7%, 64.9%, and 75.4%, respectively (differences were not statistically significant). The specificities were 98.6%, 93.5%, 88.4%, 86.3%, and 84.3%, respectively. Adding a visual test to cytology or HPV testing in parallel combination resulted in a substantial increase in sensitivity, with a moderate decrease in specificity. The parallel combination of VILI and HPV testing resulted in a sensitivity of 92.0% and a specificity of 79.9%.As a single test, cytology had the best balance of sensitivity and specificity. Visual tests are promising in low-resource settings, such as India. The use of both VIA and VILI may be considered where good quality cytology or HPV testing are not feasible. The sensitivity of cytology and HPV testing increased significantly when combined with VIA or VILI.SNIPER: a novel assay for human papillomavirus testing among women in Guizhou, China.Clinically validate the SNIPER human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA assay for the detection of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN)2 or higher and CIN2 or higher in a prospective cross-sectional screening study in Guizhou Province, China.Between March and April, 2008, 1000 nonpregnant women aged 30 or older were recruited in Guizhou Province, China. Women positive by SNIPER or cytological examination were requested to return for follow-up. A biopsy of all colposcopically detected abnormalities was performed by quadrant. In normal quadrants, biopsies were obtained at the squamocolumnar junction (2-, 4-, 8-, and 10-o'clock positions depending on the quadrant). Samples were placed in 2 mL of saline solution and maintained between 2 degrees C and 30 degrees C for up to 1 week. One milliliter of this suspension was then prepared and tested. For polymerase chain reaction amplification, a pool of HPV primers was designed to amplify HPV DNA from 13 high-risk-HPV genotypes (types 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, and 68). Test characteristics were calculated according to standard definitions.One thousand women were screened; 175 tested HPV positive, 36 women tested negative but had positive Papanicolaou test results. All but 21 (90%) returned for follow-up. Median age and proportions having CIN2 or higher and CIN3 or higher differed by HPV status. Twenty-five women had CIN2 or higher and 16 had CIN3 or higher. The SNIPER assay was 93.3% and 94% sensitive and 86% and 85% specific for the detection of CIN2 or higher and CIN3 or higher, respectively. The positive predictive value was 17.4 % and 9.9% for CIN2 or higher and CIN3 or higher, respectively. Negative predictive value approached 100% for CIN2 or higher and CIN3 or higher.The SNIPER assay is functionally competitive and in terms of cost holds an advantage over Hybrid Capture 2 in a Chinese healthcare market, and potentially others, around the world.Evaluation of human papillomavirus testing in primary screening for cervical abnormalities: comparison of sensitivity, specificity, and frequency of referral.Human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA testing of women having Papanicolaou (Pap) smears showing atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS) has clinical usefulness. Whether HPV DNA testing alone is useful in primary screening remains to be determined.To determine the accuracy of HPV DNA testing for detecting cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) grade 3 or cancer (the criterion standard).Between December 1997 and October 2000, 4075 women who attended Planned Parenthood clinics in Washington State were screened simultaneously using thin-layer Pap and HPV DNA testing by a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based method and by a liquid-based RNA-DNA hybridization capture with signal amplification assay (signal amplification). Women who were positive for high-risk HPV types, or had Pap results of ASCUS or higher, were considered to have positive screening test results and were referred for colposcopy and biopsy. Additionally, a random sample of women with negative screening test results was referred for colposcopy. Based on individual and combined thin-layer Pap, HPV PCR, and HPV signal amplification test results from the screening and the colposcopy visits, 7 colposcopy triage strategies were defined and evaluated.Sensitivity and specificity for detecting cervical lesions graded CIN 3 or higher for each of the 7 triage strategies.The estimated prevalence of CIN 3 or higher was 3.2%. The sensitivity (95% confidence interval) of thin-layer Pap (with a result of > or = ASCUS) for identifying women with CIN 3 or higher was only 61.3% (48.5%-70.9%) compared with 88.2% (78.9%-93.8%) for HPV testing by PCR and 90.8% (83.1%-95.8%) by signal amplification. Differences in specificities were also observed: 82.4% (81.8%-83.1%) for thin-layer Pap (with a result of > or = ASCUS), 78.8% (77.9%-79.7%) for PCR, and 72.6% (69.4%-75.0%) for signal amplification. Compared with referral for colposcopy of all women with ASCUS or higher, signal amplification testing of women with ASCUS and referral of those with a positive result was about as sensitive (61.3% vs 60.3%, respectively) and significantly more specific (82.4% vs 88.9%, respectively). The strategy requiring repeat positive PCR tests on 2 visits had a sensitivity of 84.2% (75.3%-91.0%) and a specificity of 86.2% (85.1%-87.3%). All tests were more specific and less sensitive in older (> or = 30 years) vs younger women.Testing for HPV has higher sensitivity but lower specificity than thin-layer Pap screening. In some settings, particularly where screening intervals are long or haphazard, screening for HPV DNA may be a reasonable alternative to cytology-based screening of reproductive-age women.Comparison of single-, double- and triple-combined testing, including Pap test, HPV DNA test and cervicography, as screening methods for the detection of uterine cervical cancer.Cervical cancer is a serious disease that threatens the health of women worldwide. This study compared the sensitivities and false-positive rates of cervical cytology (Pap smear), human papilloma virus (HPV) DNA test, cervicography, first double-combined testing (cervical cytology and HPV DNA test), second double-combined testing (cervical cytology and cervicography) and triple-combined testing (cervical cytology, HPV DNA test and cervicography). The study included 261 patients screened for uterine cervical cancer. All women simultaneously underwent cervical cytology, HPV DNA test and cervicography for uterine cervical cancer screening and colposcopically directed biopsy for diagnostic evaluation. The triple-combined testing was consistently the most sensitive among the cervical screening tests. The second double-combined testing, with a sensitivity rate of 98.1% was more sensitive than the first double-combined test (92.3%). However, cervical cytology was most specific (93.5%) and showed the highest positive predictive value (77.8%). The sensitivity of cervical cytology was markedly improved in combination with HPV DNA test and cervicography. Thus, the triple-combined testing, which improves the high false negativity of cervical cytology, may be an effective tool in uterine cervical cancer screening, pending confirmation of the effectiveness in a mass screening study.Adjunctive testing for cervical cancer in low resource settings with visual inspection, HPV, and the Pap smear.To test whether the performance of visual inspection using acetic acid (VIA) could be improved through adjunctive testing and to determine whether the combination of visual inspection of the cervix and HPV testing could prove useful for identifying those at highest risk of cervical precancer.Between October 1995 and August 1997, 2199 women willing to be screened for cervical cancer in peri-urban clinics in Harare, Zimbabwe received VIA, Pap smear and HPV as screening tests. The presence or absence of (pre)cancer was confirmed via colposcopy with biopsy as indicated for >97% of all women. Computerized simulations of sequential testing scenarios provided estimates of the joint (net) test qualities of different paired combinations of the three tests and allowed for comparisons with the individual test qualities.Using HGSIL/CIN II-III as the reference threshold of disease, the net sensitivity and specificity of VIA and HPV when used sequentially were 63.6 and 81.9%, respectively, compared to 43.3 and 91%, respectively, when Pap smears were followed by HPV testing. VIA followed by the Pap smear yielded a net sensitivity of 37.5% and net specificity of 94.3%.For programs with limited resources but with the capacity for HPV testing, sequential testing involving the use of VIA followed by HPV could yield fewer false positives than the use of VIA alone at a cost of relatively few additional false negatives.Primary screening for cervical cancer based on high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) detection and HPV 16 and HPV 18 genotyping, in comparison to cytology.The objective of the present study is to assess the performance of a high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) DNA test with individual HPV-16/HPV-18 genotyping as a method for primary cervical cancer screening compared with liquid-based cytology (LBC) in a population of Greek women taking part in routine cervical cancer screening.The study, conducted by the "HEllenic Real life Multicentric cErvical Screening" (HERMES) study group, involved the recruitment of 4,009 women, aged 25-55, who took part in routine cervical screening at nine Gynecology Departments in Greece. At first visit cervical specimens were collected for LBC and HPV testing using the Roche Cobas 4800 system. Women found positive for either cytology or HPV were referred for colposcopy, whereas women negative for both tests will be retested after three years. The study is ongoing and the results of the first screening round are reported herein.Valid results for cytology and HPV testing were obtained for 3,993 women. The overall prevalence of HR-HPV was 12.7%, of HPV-16 2.7% and of HPV-18 1.4%. Of those referred for colposcopy, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or worse (CIN2+) was detected in 41 women (1.07%). At the threshold of CIN2+, cytology [atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US) or worse] and HPV testing showed a sensitivity of 53.7% and 100% respectively, without change between age groups. Cytology and HPV testing showed specificity of 96.8% and 90.3% respectively, which was increased in older women (≥30) in comparison to younger ones (25-29). Genotyping for HPV16/18 had similar accuracy to cytology for the detection of CIN2+ (sensitivity: 58.5%; specificity 97.5%) as well as for triage to colposcopy (sensitivity: 58.5% vs 53.7% for cytology).HPV testing has much better sensitivity than cytology to identify high-grade cervical lesions with slightly lower specificity. HPV testing with individual HPV-16/HPV-18 genotyping could represent a more accurate methodology for primary cervical cancer screening in comparison to liquid-based cytology, especially in older women.Complementary procedures in cervical cancer screening in low resource settings.To evaluate the efficacy of pap smear, HPV DNA testing and colposcopy and to determine the approach for cervical cancer screening in low resource settings.Eight hundred non pregnant married women above 30 years of age were studied and subjected to pap smear examination. Hysterectomised women were excluded from the study. Selected patients were followed by HPV DNA testing by Hybrid Capture II method, colposcopy and biopsy. Sensitivity, specificity, Positive predictive value (PPV), Negative predictive value (NPV), diagnostic accuracy and kappa value (k) were calculated for each screening test.Out of eight hundred women with mean age 36.5 ± 5.94 years undergoing pap smear, ASCUS was found in 66(8.25%), ASC-H in 2(0.25%), LSIL in 48(6%), HSIL in 8(1%), inflammatory in 540(67.5%). Out of 260 women who underwent HPV DNA testing, 120 (46.15%) had abnormal cytology and/or positive HPV DNA test (Group I, n = 120) and 140(53.8%) had dual negative results (Group II, n = 140) HPV DNA test was found positive in 64 women (53.3%) in Group I. Sensitivity and specificity of pap smear was 69.2 and 63.72% while for HPV DNA testing was 92.3 and 84% respectively. PPV and NPV of pap smear, HPV DNA testing and colposcopy was 18, 40, 76.4% and 94.7, 98.9, 100% respectively. Diagnostic accuracy of pap smear (k = 0.14), HPV DNA test (k = 0.70) and colposcopy (k = 0.81) was 64.29, 84.9, and 96.8% respectively. Combining pap smear & HPV DNA testing (k = 0.25) increased the sensitivity and NPV to 100%.Sensitivity and diagnostic accuracy of HPV DNA test is more than that of pap smear and the test is not influenced by inflammatory conditions of vagina. In low resource settings, women with ASCUS and LSIL on cervical cytology should be subjected to HPV DNA test and only if found positive should be referred for colposcopy thereby reducing colposcopy referrals. Women with HSIL should be directly subjected to colposcopy guided biopsy. Using this approach, most of the preinvasive cervical lesion will be detected but few cases will still be missed among inflammatory smears, if HPV DNA testing is not supplemented.Different cervical cancer screening approaches in a Chinese multicentre study.To evaluate alternative cervical cancer screening methods, digital colposcopy and collection of cervical exfoliated cells for liquid-based cytology (LBC) and hybrid capture 2 (HC2) testing were performed among 2562 women aged 15-59 years in three study sites in the People's Republic of China (rural Shanxi province, Shenyang city in Liaoning province and Shenzhen city in Guangdong province). Visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA) was also evaluated independently from colposcopy. A total of 74 cases of histologically confirmed cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or worse (CIN2+) were identified, and 16 CIN2+ cases were imputed among unbiopsied women to correct for verification bias. Corrected sensitivity for CIN2+ was 37% for VIA, 54% for colposcopy, 87% for LBC with a threshold of atypical cells of undetermined significance (LBC>or=ASCUS), 90% for HC2, 84% for LBC using HC2 to triage ASCUS and 96% for positivity to LBC>or=ASCUS or HC2. For VIA, sensitivity was much lower among women >or=40 years (12%) than those aged <or=39 years (50%). Specificity varied from 77% for positivity to LBC>or=ASCUS or HC2, up to 94% for LBC using HC2 to triage ASCUS. In conclusion, LBC, HC2 and their combinations performed well, whereas VIA missed a majority of CIN2+, particularly in older women. Digital colposcopy performed better than VIA, but still missed nearly half of CIN2+ in this study.Human papillomavirus testing for primary screening of cervical cancer precursors.Our objective was to determine whether the addition of human papillomavirus (HPV) testing to screening cytology improves the detection of cervical cancer precursors. Women of ages 18-69 years underwent conventional Pap cytology and HPV DNA testing in a multicenter study in Newfoundland, Canada. Those with positive cytology and/or HPV and a random sample of those with dual negative results were referred for colposcopy. The study enrolled 2098 women. The relative sensitivity of HPV testing was significantly higher than cytology for all-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions [SILs; 73%; 95% confidence interval (CI), 62-82] and high grade SILs (HSILs; 90%; 95% CI, 74-97) but had lower relative specificity (62% for all-grade SILs and 51% for HSILs) than most cytological cutpoints. The rate of combined correct results for all-grade lesions was higher for HPV testing (68.8%) than for any cytological cutpoint (equivocal, 52.3%; LSILs, 51.6%; HSILs, 44.5%). The combination of HPV and an LSIL cutpoint had a negative predictive value of 68% (95% CI, 52-80) for all SILs and 100% (95% CI, 91-100) for HSILs, while referring for colposcopy only 12% of the women. We concluded that HPV testing in conjunction with cytology improved the screening efficacy of cytology alone and may allow for a more effective and safe primary screening program with increased screening intervals.Genital human papillomavirus infection among women recruited for routine cervical cancer screening or for colposcopy determined by Hybrid Capture II and polymerase chain reaction.The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical use of the Hybrid Capture (HC)-II system for the detection of human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA to identify women at risk of progression to high grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HGSIL) and carcinomas by differentiating low risk (LR) HPV types (6, 11, 42, 43, 44) and high/intermediate risk (HR) HPV types (16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, 68). Five hundred and ninety-six women were enrolled in the study. Among them, 466 attended the hospital for routine cytologic screening and 130 were referred for colposcopy because of an abnormal Pap smear. The presence of HPV DNA was tested in cervical samples collected with the Digene Cervical Sampler in Digene Specimen Transport Medium (Digene Corporation, Silver Spring, MD, U.S.A.) using the HC-II assay. Results were compared with those obtained by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the MY09-MY11 primers followed by several hybridizations with specific probes. The overall HPV positivity was 32.9% by HC-II and 37.8% by PCR. Among cytologically normal smears, 19.5% were positive by HC-II (14.3% HR) and 25.1% by PCR. Of the atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance samples, 52.9% were positive by HC-II (41.1% HR) and 55.9% by PCR. Of the low grade SIL, 64.5% were positive by HC-II (59.4% HR) and 68.7% by PCR. The HPV positivity rate was found identical by both techniques in high grade smears (81.6%) and squamous cervical carcinomas (100%). By using PCR as the reference method, the sensitivity of HC-II was higher among women with abnormal cytology than with normal cytology (87.3% vs. 70%). Specificity was 80.8% and 97.5%, respectively. In summary, these results indicate that the HC-II method and MY-PCR identified nearly equivalent prevalences of HPV in cervical smear specimens.Combined Pap smear, cervicography and HPV DNA testing in the detection of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and cancer.The sensitivity of the Pap smear (PAP) continues to be the subject of debate. During the past several years, cervicography (CER) and HPV DNA testing have been suggested as optional tools in the screening of cervical cancer precursors.The performance characteristics of PAP, CER and HPV DNA testing (hybrid capture test [HCT]) in all potential combinations were evaluated in a series of 1,030 women (aged 16-70, median, 33), subjected to colposcopy (COLPO) as the reference tool.Of the 992 evaluable cases, 402/992 (41%) had positive COLPO (i.e., an abnormal transformation zone). Of them, 298 women underwent directed punch biopsy, while of the COLPO negative patients, 18/93 positive by at least one of the three tests had endocervical curettage. Of the 402 COLPO positive women, 146 (36%) remained negative on all tests, whereas 256 (64%) had at least one positive test. There were 84 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 2 and 3 lesions and 6 invasive carcinomas. Of the former, 10 were detected by PAP alone, 4 by CER alone and 3 by HCT alone. Three of the 6 carcinomas were HCT negative. The predictive value (PPV) of a positive test was 45% for PAP, 51% for CER and 48% for HCT. The combinations of PAP with CER (for PAP negative cases) and PAP with HCT were more sensitive for CIN 2 and 3 (95% and 94%, respectively) as compared with PAP alone but were associated with a significant decrease in specificity (44% and 46% vs. 57%, respectively). However, both combinations retained a PPV (43%) similar to that of PAP alone (45%).The potential combinations of PAP with CER and with HCT were more sensitive in detecting CIN 2 and 3 as compared with PAP alone and retained a PPV similar to that of PAP.A comparison of single and combined visual, cytologic, and virologic tests as screening strategies in a region at high risk of cervical cancer.Increased understanding of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection as the central cause of cervical cancer has permitted the development of improved screening techniques. To evaluate their usefulness, we evaluated the performance of multiple screening methods concurrently in a large population-based cohort of >8500 nonvirginal women without hysterectomies, whom we followed prospectively in a high-risk region of Latin America. Using Youden's index as a measure of the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity, we estimated the performances of a visual screening method (cervicography), conventional cytology, liquid-based cytology (ThinPrep), and DNA testing for 13 oncogenic HPV types. The reference standard of disease was neoplasia > or = cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 (CIN 3), defined as histologically confirmed CIN 3 detected within 2 years of enrollment (n=90) or invasive cancer detected within 7 years (n=20). We analyzed each technique alone and in paired combinations (n=112 possible strategies), and evaluated the significance of differences between strategies using a paired Z test that equally weighted sensitivity and specificity. As a single test, either liquid-based cytology or HPV DNA testing was significantly more accurate than conventional cytology or cervicography. Paired tests incorporating either liquid-based cytology or HPV DNA testing were not substantially more accurate than either of those two test strategies alone. However, a possibly useful synergy was observed between the conventional smear and cervicography. Consideration of age or behavioral risk profiles did not alter any of these conclusions. Overall, we conclude that highly accurate screening for cervical cancer and CIN 3 is now technically feasible. The remaining vital issue is to extend improved cervical cancer prevention programs to resource-poor regions.Evaluation of alternative methods of cervical cancer screening for resource-poor settings.Noncytologic methods of screening for cervical carcinoma and its precursor lesions are needed for resource-poor settings in which cervical carcinoma continues to be an important cause of morbidity and mortality.Two thousand nine hundred forty-four women ages 35-65 years were recruited from Cape Town, South Africa and screened using a combination of a Papanicolaou (Pap) smear, human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA testing, direct visual inspection after the application of a 5% acetic acid solution (DVI), and cervicography. Cervicography was considered primarily as a method with which to quality control the DVI examinations. Women with squamous intraepithelial lesions (SIL) or carcinoma on Pap smear, positive DVI examination (acetowhite lesion or cervical ulcer/growth), high levels of high risk HPV DNA (relative light units [RLU] > 10x positive control), or positive Cervigramtrade mark were referred for colposcopy and cervical biopsy.Pap smears were positive in 8.1% of all women screened and identified 65 (78%) of all cases of biopsy confirmed high grade disease (high grade SIL or invasive carcinoma). DVI and cervicography were classified as positive in 18.1% and 10.5%, respectively, of women screened and identified 58 (67%) and 46 (58%) of all cases of high grade disease, respectively. The results of HPV DNA testing varied depending on the cutoff value used to define a positive result. At the standard cutoff level (RLU > 1x positive control), 16.2% of women screened were classified as high risk HPV DNA positive, as were 63 women with high grade disease (73%).DVI and HPV DNA testing identified similar numbers of high grade SIL (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia Grade 2,3) and invasive carcinoma cases as Pap smears. However, both classify considerably more women without cervical disease as being test positive.Evaluation of a cervical cancer screening program based on HPV testing and LLETZ excision in a low resource setting.We conducted studies in Vanuatu to evaluate potential screening and treatment strategies to assist with control of cervical cancer. In a pilot study of 496 women, visual inspection and cytology were evaluated as screening tests for detection of CIN 2 or worse (CIN2+), observed in 21 of 206 subjects biopsied on the basis of abnormal visual inspection or cytology. Sensitivity of visual inspection with Lugol's Iodine for detection of CIN2+ on biopsy was 0.63, specificity was 0.32, and the positive predictive value was 0.09. For HSIL cytology, sensitivity was 0.99, specificity was 0.77, and the positive predictive value was 0.88. HSIL cytology was significantly more sensitive and had a significantly higher PPV for CIN 2+ than visual inspection (p<0.01). In a further study of 514 women, we compared testing for HR HPV and cytology as predictors of biopsy proven CIN 2+. Sensitivity of HSIL cytology for CIN2+ as established by loop excision of the cervix was 0.81, specificity was 0.94, and positive predictive value was 0.48. Sensitivity of a positive test for HR HPV for detection of CIN2+ was non-significantly different from cytology at 0.81, specificity was 0.94, and positive predictive value was 0.42. Combining the two tests gave a significantly lower sensitivity of 0.63, a specificity of 0.98, and a positive predictive value of 0.68. For women over 30 in a low resource setting without access to cytology, a single locally conducted test for high risk HPV with effective intervention could reduce cervical cancer risk as effectively as intervention based on cytology conducted in an accredited laboratory.Clinical prediction based on HPV DNA testing by hybrid capture 2 (HC2) in combination with liquid-based cytology (LBC).Primary screening by HPV DNA testing is an effective method for reducing cervical cancer and has proven more sensitive than cytology. To advance this approach, many molecular methods have been developed. Hybrid capture 2 provides semi-quantitative results in ratios of relative light units and positive cutoff values (RLU/ PC). Twenty-five thousand and five patients were included in this study to analyze the correlation between the ratio of RLU/PC and stage of cervical dysplasia. The results show that the RLU/PC ratios ranged from 0-3500 while almost normal cases, ASC-US and ASC-H, had values below 200. Of those samples negative for cytology markers, 94.6% were normal and their RLU/PC ratios were less than 4. With an RLU/PC ratio greater than 4 and less than or equal to 300, the percentages in all age groups were normal 53.6%, LSIL 20.2%, ASC-US 17.2%, HSIL 6.13%, ASC-H 2.72%, and AGC 0.11%, respectively. In contrast, 64.0% of samples with a RLU/ PC ratio greater than 300 and less than or equal to 3500 were LSIL. These results should contribute to cost effective cervical cancer management strategies. Further studies of associations with particular HPV genotypes would be useful to predict the risk of progression to cancer.A comparison of HPV DNA testing and liquid based cytology over three rounds of primary cervical screening: extended follow up in the ARTISTIC trial.The additional sensitivity of HPV testing compared with cytology could permit extended cervical screening intervals. We wished to determine, through a further (third) round of screening in the ARTISTIC trial, the protection provided by a negative baseline HPV screen compared with that of cytology over a 6 year period.Cumulative rates of CIN2 or worse (CIN2+) and CIN3 or worse (CIN3+) were correlated with baseline HPV status and cytology. HPV was detected using the Hybrid Capture 2 (Qiagen) assay for high risk types and genotyped using the Linear Array (Roche) and Papillocheck (Greiner) assays. LBC was performed using ThinPrep (Hologic).Round 3 included 8,873 women of whom 6,337 had been screened in both rounds 1 and 2 and 2,536 had not been screened since round 1. The median duration of follow-up was 72.7 months. The cumulative rate of CIN2+ over three rounds was 3.88% (95%CI 3.59%, 4.17%) overall; 2.39% in round 1, 0.78% in round 2 and 0.74% in round 3. Cumulative rates by baseline status were 20.53% (95%CI 19.04%, 22.08%) for abnormal cytology, 20.12% (95%CI 18.68%, 21.61%) for HPV detection, 1.41% (95%CI 1.19%, 1.65%) for negative cytology and 0.87% (95%CI 0.70%, 1.06%) for a negative HPV test. In HPV negative women aged over 50 the cumulative rate was 0.16% (95%CI 0.07%, 0.34%). Women who were HPV positive/cytology negative at entry had a cumulative CIN2+ rate of 7.73% (95%CI 6.29%, 9.36%) over 6 years, twice the overall rate.A negative HPV test was significantly more protective than normal cytology over three rounds. The findings of this extension of ARTISTIC suggest that the screening interval could be extended to 6 years if HPV testing replaced cytology as the primary screening test.A population-based clinical trial comparing endocervical high-risk HPV testing using hybrid capture 2 and Cervista from the SHENCCAST II Study.Our objective was to directly compare the accuracy of the high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) assays, Hybrid Capture 2 (hc2; Qiagen, Gaithersburg, MD) and Cervista (Hologic, Bedford, MA), in diagnosing cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 3 or worse (cancer). A population-based, cross-sectional study (The Shenzhen Cervical Cancer Screening Trial II) was conducted in Guangdong Province in China. Three high-risk HPV assays, self and direct cervical sampling and cytology, were studied. Abnormal results on any of 6 study tests (33%) resulted in referral to colposcopy. At colposcopy, every patient had at least 5 cervical biopsy specimens obtained. For 8,556 women between the ages of 25 and 59 years (mean, 38.9 years), the rate for CIN 3 or worse was 1.6% (141/8,556). The sensitivity (confidence interval) values for CIN 3 or worse were 97.9% (94.0%-99.6%) and 95.1% (90.0%-98.0%) for hc2 and Cervista, respectively (P > .05). The specificity (confidence interval) values were 87.8% (87.1%-88.5%) and 90.3% (89.6%-90.9%), respectively (P < .05). Differences in accuracy in diagnosing CIN 3 or worse with the hc2 and Cervista tests are minor and result from the decisions made in selecting the cut points.Factors associated with colposcopy-histopathology confirmed cervical intraepithelial neoplasia among HIV-infected women from Rio De Janeiro, Brazil.Despite the availability of preventive strategies (screening tests and vaccines), cervical cancer continues to impose a significant health burden in low- and medium-resourced countries. HIV-infected women are at increased risk for infection with human papillomavirus (HPV) and thus development of cervical squamous intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN).Study participants included HIV-infected women enrolling the prospective open cohort of Evandro Chagas Clinical Research Institute, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (IPEC/FIOCRUZ). At cohort entry, women were subjected to conventional Papanicolaou test, HPV-DNA test and colposcopy; lesions suspicious for CIN were biopsied. Histopathology report was based on directed biopsy or on specimens obtained by excision of the transformation zone or cervical conization. Poisson regression modeling was used to assess factors associated with CIN2+ diagnosis.The median age of the 366 HIV-infected women included in the study was 34 years (interquartile range: 28-41 years). The prevalence of CIN1, CIN2 and CIN3 were 20.0%, 3.5%, and 2.2%, respectively. One woman was found to have cervical cancer. The prevalence of CIN2+ was 6.0%. Factors associated with CIN2+ diagnosis in the multivariate model were age < years compared to ≥ 35 years (aPR = 3.22 95%CI 1.23-8.39), current tobacco use (aPR = 3.69 95%CI 1.54-8.78), nadir CD4 T-cell count <350 cells/mm3 when compared to ≥ 350 cells/mm3 (aPR = 6.03 95%CI 1.50-24.3) and concomitant diagnosis of vulvar and/or vaginal intraepithelial lesion (aPR = 2.68 95%CI 0.99-7.24).Increased survival through wide-spread use of highly active antiretroviral therapy might allow for the development of cervical cancer. In Brazil, limited cytology screening and gynecological care adds further complexity to the HIV-HPV co-infection problem. Integrated HIV care and cervical cancer prevention programs are needed for the prevention of cervical cancer mortality in this group of women.Efficiency of the hybrid capture 2 HPV DNA test in cervical cancer screening. A study by the French Society of Clinical Cytology.The aim of this study was to determine the efficiency of the Hybrid Capture 2 (HC2; Digene, Gaithersburg, MD) human papillomavirus (HPV) assay for the detection of cervical neoplasia. Of the 1,785 patients recruited, 462 (25.88%) were referred for colposcopy owing to previously detected cytologic abnormalities, and 1,323 (74.12%) were voluntary candidates for screening. For all patients, a Papanicolaou smear and a monolayer smear (ThinPrep, Cytyc, Boxborough, MA) were done. HPV DNA was detected on the residual liquid-based material. False-positive results were observed in 111 cases and comprised 34 cross-reactions (1.90%) and 77 false-positive cases (4.31%) owing to a contiguous strong chemiluminescence signal. Interestingly, all these samples had a relative light units value of 1 to 3 and were contiguous to a sample with a very high HPV DNA load. The final results showed that high-risk and low-risk HPV DNA were detected in 480 samples (26.89%) and 135 samples (7.56%), respectively. Although HC2 can be considered a reliable and sensitive test for HPV DNA detection, we do not advocate its use for large-scale screening for cervical neoplasia.Detection of human telomerase RNA gene in cervical cancer and precancerous lesions: comparison with cytological and human papillomavirus DNA test findings.The aims of this study were to compare the findings of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) detection of human telomerase RNA gene (hTERC) amplification with that of cytological and human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA tests and explore the possibility to improve the accuracy of the diagnoses of high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and cervical cancer.A total of 201 specimens of liquid-based thin-layer cytological examination findings were collected and detected by HPV DNA test and hTERC detected by FISH. All women underwent colposcopy and histological examination of biopsy specimen if needed. The 3 screening methods were compared based on histological examination of colposcopic biopsies.The amplification of hTERC showed 6.06% in normal or inflammation cases, 10.00% in CIN 1, 66.67% in CIN 2, 72.50% in CIN 3, and 100.00% in carcinoma, with significant difference between the low- (<or=CIN 1 or <or=low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion) and high-grade (>or=CIN 2 or >or=atypical squamous cells in which high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion cannot be excluded) cervical lesions (P < 0.001). The hTERC amplification rate was consistent with abnormal rates of cytological and histological diagnoses. The detection of hTERC amplification had a much higher accuracy (87.56%) than the cytological (80.10%) and HPV DNA test (77.61%) findings.Using FISH to detect the amplification of hTERC had a much higher specificity and accuracy for the diagnoses of high-grade CIN and cervical cancer than cytological and HPV DNA test findings, suggesting that this detection might be a useful and specific screening method in cervical cancer and precancerous lesions.Human papillomavirus testing and conventional pap smear cytology as optional screening tools of women at different risks for cervical cancer in the countries of the former soviet union.Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is a sexually transmitted disease (STD) and the single most important etiological agent of cervical cancer. In parallel with the increase of STDs and because of the lack of any organized cancer screening in the new independent states of the former Soviet Union, the incidence and mortality rates of cervical cancer are rapidly rising. This is the first report from an ongoing European Commission-funded (INCO-Copernicus Program) cross-sectional and cohort study (focused on the key issues of this major health problem in the new independent states) analyzing the performance of the HPV DNA (Hybrid Capture II) test as a potential screening tool for cervical cancer in these countries.A series of 3,175 women (screening, gynecological, or STD patients) from six clinics in Russia, Belarus, and Latvia received routine cytology and HPV testing with Hybrid Capture II (HCII). All women with HPV-positive results or abnormalities in cytology were subjected to colposcopy and biopsy. The sensitivity, specificity, receiver operating characteristics, as well as positive (PPV) and negative predicting values (NPV), were determined for HCII and quality-controlled cytology in detecting significant pathology (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia [CIN] 3 and cancer).Significant pathology was strongly associated with high-grade cytology (odds ratio [OR] = 8.5; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 4.1-17.8; chi-square, p < .0001). Pap smear cytology detected high-grade lesions with a sensitivity of 64.0% (44.8-83.2), specificity of 89.1% (84.5-93.7), PPV of 44.4% (28.8-61.0), and NPV of 94.8% (91.2-98.4). Of the 3,086 samples analyzed by HCII, 33.0% were positive for oncogenic HPV types, with a wide variation (from 23% to 45%) between the three patient groups (p < .0001). The presence of high-grade cytology was significantly associated with HCII positivity at all cutoff levels (OR = 14.4; 95% CI = 8.4-24.5; chi-square, p < .0001; 1 pg/mL threshold). In the receiver operating characteristics curve, the HCII cutoff point most closely balancing sensitivity (83.1%) and specificity (75.6%) was 2 pg/mL. The presence of high-grade histology was associated with HCII positivity (cutoff 1 pg/mL; OR = 4.8; 95% CI = 0.7-34.2;p = .047). At the cutoff (1 pg/mL), sensitivity of the HCII test was 96.6% (90.0-100), specificity was 15.9% (10.6-21.2), PPV was 15.1% (9.9-20.3), and NPV was 96.8% (90.3-100). Changing the cutoff significantly affected sensitivity at 20 pg/mL and NPV at 500 pg/mL.HCII assay is a sensitive tool in detecting significant pathology, but less specific than the Pap test. A negative HCII test practically precludes high-grade CIN (NPV, >95%). Because the performance characteristics of the HCII test depend on the prevalence of HPV and CIN in the study population, the cost-benefit issues in different settings will be the limiting factor for the application of this test as a screening tool.Expanded cytological referral criteria for colposcopy in cervical screening: comparison with human papillomavirus testing.The goal of this study was to investigate whether expanded cytologic referral criteria for colposcopy or the addition of human papillomavirus (HPV) testing on cervical screening could improve the rates of detection of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN).HPV testing by semiquantitative polymerase chain reaction/ELISA was performed in 1000 women who were self-referred for routine Pap smear. They underwent colposcopy following an abnormal smear result or a positive HPV test. As abnormal smear results were considered reports of low- or high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion, atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance, and even HPV-associated reactive cellular changes (mild koilocytosis, mild dyskeratocytosis, hyperchromatic nuclei, bimultinucleation, and cleared cytoplasm). Loop excision of the transformation zone was performed in women with cytology and colposcopy indicative of CIN, as well as in women with normal cytology but positive HPV test and colposcopic impression of CIN.The Pap test was abnormal in 89% of the cases of CIN 1 (34/38) and 96% of CIN 2/3 (27/28) diagnosed in our population. HPV testing picked up four additional cases of CIN 1 (11%) and one case of CIN 2/3 (4%). Overall the HPV test detected 95% of the cases of CIN 1 (36/38) and 89% of the cases of CIN 2/3 (25/28).HPV testing does not appear to add significantly to cytology in terms of positive predictive value or detection rate, if extended cytologic indications for colposcopy are used.The probability for a Pap test to be abnormal is directly proportional to HPV viral load: results from a Swiss study comparing HPV testing and liquid-based cytology to detect cervical cancer precursors in 13,842 women.In a study involving 13,842 women and 113 gynaecologists, liquid-based cytology and HPV testing for detecting cervical cancer were compared. A total of 1334 women were found to be positive for one or both tests and were invited for colposcopy with biopsy. A total of 1031 satisfactory biopsies on 1031 women were thereafter collected using a systematic biopsy protocol, which was random in the colposcopically normal-appearing cervix or directed in the abnormal one. In all, 502 women with negative tests were also biopsied. A total of 82 histologic high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) were reported in biopsies, all from the group with one or both tests positive. Sensitivity and specificity to detect histologic HSIL were 59 and 97% for cytology, and 97 and 92% for HPV. In total, 14% of reviewed negative cytological preparations associated with histologic HSIL contained no morphologically abnormal cells despite a positive HPV test. This suggested a theoretical limit for cytology sensitivity. HPV viral load analysis of the 1143 HPV-positive samples showed a direct relationship between abnormal Pap test frequency and HPV viral load. Thus, not only does the HPV testing have a greater sensitivity than cytology but the probability of the latter being positive can also be defined as a function of the associated HPV viral load.The performance of human papillomavirus high-risk DNA testing in the screening and diagnostic settings.We sought to evaluate the performance of the human papillomavirus high-risk DNA test in patients 30 years and older.Screening (n=835) and diagnosis (n=518) groups were defined based on prior Papanicolaou smear results as part of a clinical trial for cervical cancer detection. We compared the Hybrid Capture II (HCII) test result with the worst histologic report. We used cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 2/3 or worse as the reference of disease. We calculated sensitivities, specificities, positive and negative likelihood ratios (LR+ and LR-), receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, and areas under the ROC curves for the HCII test. We also considered alternative strategies, including Papanicolaou smear, a combination of Papanicolaou smear and the HCII test, a sequence of Papanicolaou smear followed by the HCII test, and a sequence of the HCII test followed by Papanicolaou smear.For the screening group, the sensitivity was 0.69 and the specificity was 0.93; the area under the ROC curve was 0.81. The LR+ and LR- were 10.24 and 0.34, respectively. For the diagnosis group, the sensitivity was 0.88 and the specificity was 0.78; the area under the ROC curve was 0.83. The LR+ and LR- were 4.06 and 0.14, respectively. Sequential testing showed little or no improvement over the combination testing.The HCII test in the screening group had a greater LR+ for the detection of CIN 2/3 or worse. HCII testing may be an additional screening tool for cervical cancer in women 30 years and older.Primary cervical cancer screening and triage using an mRNA human papillomavirus assay and visual inspection.Mexican Cervical Cancer Screening Study II (MECCS II) seeks to develop a highly sensitive and highly specific screening program able to be adapted to all socioeconomic levels in Mexico. The objectives of MECCS II are (1) to compare the sensitivity and specificity for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 3 or cancer of self-collected vaginal specimens tested for high-risk types of the human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) by APTIMA with those tested for HR-HPV by Hybrid Capture 2 (HC2); and (2) determine the efficacy of cryotherapy in the treatment of HR-HPV-positive and acetic acid-aided visual inspection (VIA)-positive and -negative women after VIA triage.The study was conducted in rural Mexico. Women aged 30 to 50 years, nonpregnant, with no history of hysterectomy or pelvic irradiation and varied histories of screening, participated. A direct endocervical sample was tested for cytology, HC2, and APTIMA assay (AHPV). Subjects positive on any test were recalled for triage VIA, biopsies, and immediate cryotherapy. Tests were compared using McNemar test.Two thousand forty-nine patients have complete results. Mean age of the patients was 39.2 years; 7.7% presented with ≥atypical squamous cells of uncertain significance (ASCUS), 1.8% ≥low-grade squamous intraepithelial neoplasia, and 0.5% ≥high-grade squamous intraepithelial neoplasia. Two percent of patients had ≥CIN2, and 0.78% had ≥CIN3 (including 2 with invasive disease). The sensitivity of ThinPrep (>ASCUS), HC2, and AHPV for >CIN3 for direct endocervical collection was 87.5%, 100%, and 100%, respectively. The specificity of ThinPrep (>ASCUS), HC2, and AHPV for >CIN3 was 94.1%, 92.2%, and 93.5%, respectively. Specificities of HC2 and AHPV differed significantly. The overall percentage of agreement among HPV assays (HC2 vs APTIMA) is 97%. Four hundred sixty-nine women returned for VIA. Two hundred ninety-one women were treated with cryotherapy.The specificity of the APTIMA assay along with high sensitivity is an advantage for primary screening. Follow-up evaluation will be important to determine the true impact of potential undertreatment in the screening algorithm. Self-sampling applications are explored.Prevalence of type-specific human papillomavirus in endocervical, upper and lower vaginal, perineal and vaginal self-collected specimens: Implications for vaginal self-collection.To determine why a vaginal self-collection tested for high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) by Hybrid Capture 2(R) (hc2) has lower sensitivity and specificity for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia Grade 2 or worse (> or = CIN 2), we collected 5 specimens (endocervix, upper and lower vagina, perineum, vaginal self-collection) from 2,625 women. Endocervical and self-collected specimens had HR-HPV tests by hc2. All 5 anogenital specimens were tested for 37 HPV genotypes [Linear Array(R), (LA)] from 397 women hc2 positive in endocervical or self-collected specimens and for a randomly selected 71 of 2,228 women hc2 negative on both specimens. Three hundred nintey-five women who screened positive by hc2 or had abnormal cytology underwent colposcopic evaluation. Of 47 women with > or = CIN 2, hc2 was positive in 97.9% (46/47) of endocervical and 80.9% (38/47), p = 0.008 of self-collected specimens. Seven of 9 women with > or = CIN 2 and negative self-collected hc2 tests were positive for HR-HPV by LA. Of 2,578 women without > or = CIN 2, hc2 was positive in 9.8% (253/2,578) of endocervical and 11.4% (294/2,578), p = 0.001 of self-collected specimens. Of the 41 more women without > or = CIN 2 that tested hc2 positive on the self-collected but negative on endocervical specimen, LA tested positive for HR-HPV in 24, negative for HPV in 11 and negative for HR-HPV but positive for low-risk HPV in 6. Lower sensitivity of self-collected specimens is secondary to lower levels of vaginal HR-HPV. The principal cause of the lower specificity of self-collected specimens is HR-HPV present solely in the vagina, which is not associated with > or = CIN 2.Effectiveness of VIA, Pap, and HPV DNA testing in a cervical cancer screening program in a peri-urban community in Andhra Pradesh, India.While many studies have compared the efficacy of Pap cytology, visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA) and human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA assays for the detection cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and cancer, few have evaluated the program effectiveness.A population-based sample of 5603 women from Medchal Mandal in Andhra Pradesh, India were invited to participate in a study comparing Pap cytology, VIA, and HPV DNA screening for the detection of CIN3+. Participation in primary screening and all subsequent follow-up visits was rigorously tracked. A 20% random sample of all women screened, in addition to all women with a positive screening test result underwent colposcopy with directed biopsy for final diagnosis. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values were adjusted for verification bias. HPV testing had a higher sensitivity (100%) and specificity (90.6%) compared to Pap cytology (sensitivity = 78.2%; specificity = 86.0%) and VIA (sensitivity = 31.6%; specificity = 87.5%). Since 58% of the sample refused involvement and another 28% refused colposcopy or biopsy, we estimated that potentially 87.6% of the total underlying cases of CIN3 and cancer may have been missed due to program failures.We conclude that despite our use of available resources, infrastructure, and guidelines for cervical cancer screening implementation in resource limited areas, community participation and non-compliance remain the major obstacles to successful reduction in cervical cancer mortality in this Indian population. HPV DNA testing was both more sensitive and specific than Pap cytology and VIA. The use of a less invasive and more user-friendly primary screening strategy (such as self-collected swabs for HPV DNA testing) may be required to achieve the coverage necessary for effective reduction in cervical cancer mortality.HPV DNA testing in population-based cervical screening (VUSA-Screen study): results and implications.Human papillomavirus (HPV) testing is more sensitive than cytology for detecting high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). We evaluated the performance of high-risk HPV (hrHPV) testing in routine screening.In all, 25,871 women (29-61) enrolled in our population-based cohort study were offered both cytology and hrHPV testing. High-risk HPV-positive women with normal cytology and an age-matched subcohort of hrHPV-negative women with normal cytology were invited for repeat testing after 1 and/or 2 years and were referred for colposcopy if they presented with abnormal cytology and/or a positive hrHPV test. The hrHPV-positive women with borderline or mild dyskaryosis (BMD) and all women with moderate dyskaryosis or worse (>BMD) were directly referred for colposcopy. Women with BMD and an hrHPV-negative test were advised to repeat cytology at 6 and 18 months and were referred for colposcopy if the repeat cytology test was abnormal. The main outcome measure was CIN grade 3 or worse (CIN3+). Results were adjusted for non-attendance at repeat testing.The hrHPV-positive women with abnormal cytology had a CIN3+ risk of 42.2% (95% confidence interval (CI): 36.4-48.2), whereas the hrHPV-positive women with normal cytology had a much lower risk of 5.22% (95% CI: 3.72-7.91). In hrHPV-positive women with normal cytology, an additional cytology step after 1 year reduced the CIN3+ risk to only 1.6% (95% CI: 0.6-4.9) if the repeat test was normal. The CIN3+ risk in women with hrHPV-positive normal cytology was higher among women invited for the first time (29-33 years of age) (9.1%; 95% CI: 5.6-14.3) than among older women (3.0%; 95% CI: 1.5-5.5).Primary hrHPV screening with cytology triage in women aged 30 years is an effective way to stratify women on CIN3+ risk and seems a feasible alternative to cytological screening. Repeat cytology after 1 year for hrHPV-positive women with normal cytology is however necessary before returning women to routine screening.Cross sectional study of conventional cervical smear, monolayer cytology, and human papillomavirus DNA testing for cervical cancer screening.To compare the sensitivity, specificity, and interobserver reliability of conventional cervical smear tests, monolayer cytology, and human papillomavirus testing for screening for cervical cancer.Cross sectional study in which the three techniques were performed simultaneously with a reference standard (colposcopy and histology).Public university and private practices in France, with complete independence from the suppliers.828 women referred for colposcopy because of previously detected cytological abnormalities and 1757 women attending for routine smears.Clinical readings and optimised interpretation (two blind readings followed, if necessary, by consensus). Sensitivity, specificity, and weighted kappa computed for various thresholds of abnormalities.Conventional cervical smear tests were more often satisfactory (91% v 87%) according to the Bethesda system, more reliable (weighted kappa 0.70 v 0.57), and had consistently better sensitivity and specificity than monolayer cytology. These findings applied to clinical readings and optimised interpretations, low and high grade lesions, and populations with low and high incidence of abnormalities. Human papillomavirus testing associated with monolayer cytology, whether systematic or for atypical cells of undetermined significance, performed no better than conventional smear tests.Monolayer cytology is less reliable and more likely to give false positive and false negative results than conventional cervical smear tests for screening for cervical cancer.Population-based cervical cancer screening using high-risk HPV DNA test and liquid-based cytology in northern Thailand.Northern Thailand is a region with a high cervical cancer incidence. Combined high-risk HPV (hrHPV) DNA testing and cytology (co-testing) has increasingly gained acceptance for cervical cancer screening. However, to our knowledge, data from a population-based screening using co-testing have not been available in this region. This study therefore aimed to evaluate the performance of cytology and hrHPV test in women in northern Thailand.Cervical samples were collected for hybrid capture 2 (HC2) testing and liquid-based cytology from women aged 30 to 60 years who were residents in 3 prefectures of Chiang Mai in northern Thailand between May and September 2011. Women with positive cytology were referred to colposcopy, while women with positive for HC2 only were followed for 2 years.Of 2,752 women included in this study, 3.0% were positive in both tests, 4.1% for HC2 only, and 1.3% had positive cytology only. At baseline screening, positive HC2 was observed in 70.6% among cytology-positive women compared with 4.3% among cytology-negative women. The prevalence of positive HC2 or cytology peaked in the age group 35-39 years and was lowest in the age group 55-60 years. High-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion or worse lesions (HSIL+) were histologically detected in 23.5% of women with positive baseline cytology and in 9.8% of women with positive baseline HC2 only on follow-up. All women with histologic HSIL+ had positive baseline HC2.The hrHPV test is superior to cytology in the early detection of high-grade cervical epithelial lesions. In this study, the prevalence of histologic HSIL+ on follow-up of women with positive hrHPV test was rather high, and these women should be kept under careful surveillance. In northern Thailand, hrHPV testing has a potential to be used as a primary screening test for cervical cancer with cytology applied as a triage test.A cluster randomized controlled trial of visual, cytology and human papillomavirus screening for cancer of the cervix in rural India.The impact of screening by visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA), cytology or HPV testing on cervical cancer incidence and mortality is investigated in a cluster randomized controlled trial in India. We report findings after the screening phase, when 52 clusters, with a total of 142,701 women aged 30-59 years in Osmanabad District, India, were randomized into 4 arms for a single round of screening by trained midwives with either VIA, cytology or HPV testing as well as a control group. All laboratory tests were done locally. Test-positive women underwent investigations (colposcopy/biopsy) and treatment in the base hospital. Data on participation, test positivity, positive predictive value and detection rates of cervical neoplasia were analyzed using cluster design methodology. Of the eligible women, 72-74% were screened. Test positivity rates were 14.0% for VIA, 7.0% for cytology and 10.3% for HPV. The detection rate of high-grade lesions was similar in all intervention arms (0.7% for VIA, 1.0% for cytology and 0.9% for HPV testing) (p = 0.06, Mann-Whitney test). While the detection rate for VIA dropped to 0.5% with declining test positivity during the course of the study, it remained constant for cytology and HPV testing. Over 85% of women with high-grade lesions received treatment. Our results show that a high level of participation and good-quality cytology can be achieved in low-resource settings. VIA is a useful alternative but requires careful monitoring. Detection rates obtained by HPV testing were similar to cytology, despite higher investments.Shanxi Province Cervical Cancer Screening Study: a cross-sectional comparative trial of multiple techniques to detect cervical neoplasia.The aim of this study was to design a cervical cancer screening algorithm for the developing world that is highly sensitive for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) II, III, and cancer and highly specific for CIN II and III, making it possible to ablate the transformation zone without histologic confirmation.In rural Shanxi Province, China, we examined 1997 women ages 35-45. Each subject underwent a self-test for intermediate and high-risk HPV (by HC-II assay), fluorescence spectroscopy, a liquid-based Pap (read manually and by computer and used as a direct test for HPV), a visual inspection (VIA) diagnosis, and colposcopy with multiple cervical biopsies.Mean age was 39.1 +/- 3.16 years, mean number of births was 2.6 +/- 0.93. Based on tests administered, 4.3% subjects had > or =CIN II. All subjects with > or =CIN II had either a ThinPrep Pap (> or =ASCUS) or a positive HPV direct test. The sensitivity and specificity for the detection of > or =CIN II were, respectively, 83 and 86% for the HPV self-test, 95 and 85% for the HPV direct test, 94 and 78% for the ThinPrep Pap (> or =ASCUS), 77 and 98% for the ThinPrep Pap (> or =HGSIL), 94 and 9% for fluorescence spectroscopy, 71 and 74% for VIA, and 81 and 77% for colposcopy.Based on these data and the existing healthcare infrastructure in China, we believe that further refinement of primary HPV screening using centralized labs is indicated. Self-testing in the local villages may be effective with improvements in the devices and techniques.Hybrid capture II for high-risk human papillomavirus DNA testing to detect cervical precancerous lesions: A qualitative and quantitative study.Hybrid capture II (HC-II) is the only technique that can be used in clinical human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA detection. However, there is controversy in regards to how to analyze and assess the viral load of high-risk (HR)-HPV by use of HC-II and the relation between viral load and cervical lesions. In this study, we analyzed the results of a sequential screening of outpatients at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology of the China-Japan Friendship Hospital, and we aimed to explore the relationship between HR-HPV viral load and the severity of cervical lesions, and to clarify the clinical significance of the titer of HR-HPV DNA determined by HC-II. Using HC-II, 2,761 women were screened for HR-HPV DNA combined with cytological testing using liquid-based cytology. All women with HR-HPV-positive results or abnormalities in cytology underwent a cervical biopsy through colposcopy. Cervical biopsies were taken in 1,051 women. The HR-HPV infection rate was 78.35% (76/97) in HPV-associated lesions, 87.33% (193/221) in cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) I, 94.74% (144/152) in CIN II, 100% (178/178) in CIN III and 100% (20/20) in invasive cervical cancer (ICC), respectively (P<0.05). Based on the criteria of histopathology, the sensitivity of HR-HPV DNA testing by HC-II for detecting high-grade cervical lesions was 97.71%, the specificity was 79.64%, the positive-predictive value was 41.06% and the negative-predictive value was 99.59%. The viral loads of HR-HPV DNA were 512.15±764.19 in HPV-associated lesions, 753.95±978.27 in CIN I, 871.08±1003.52 in CIN II, 603.40±740.25 in CIN III and 466.44±673.05 in ICC, respectively. In conclusion, the positive rate of HR-HPV increased significantly in accordance with the severity of cervical lesions. The viral loads of cervical inflammatory lesions were markedly lower than CINs and ICC. The viral loads of HR-HPV DNA tested by HC-II had no correlation with the grade of cervical lesions.Clinical validation of a type-specific real-time quantitative human papillomavirus PCR against the performance of hybrid capture 2 for the purpose of cervical cancer screening.To be acceptable for use in cervical cancer screening, a new assay that detects DNA of high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) types must demonstrate high reproducibility and performance not inferior to that of a clinically validated HPV test. In the present study, a real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay targeting the E6 and E7 genes of hrHPV was compared with Hybrid Capture 2 (hc2) in a Belgian cervical cancer screening setting. In women >30 years old, the sensitivity and specificity for intraepithelial neoplasias of grade 2 or worse (93 cases of cervical intraepithelial neoplasias of grade 2 or worse (CIN2+) and 1,207 cases of no CIN or CIN1) were 93.6% and 95.6%, respectively, and those of hc2 were 83.9% and 94.5%, respectively {relative sensitivity of qPCR/hc2 = 1.12 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.01 to 1.23]; relative specificity = 1.01 [95% CI, 0.99 to 1.03]}. A score test showed that the sensitivity (P < 0.0001) and specificity (P < 0.0001) of the qPCR assay were not inferior to those of hc2 at the required thresholds of 90% and 98%, respectively. The overall agreement of hrHPV positivity between the two runs of the qPCR tests was 98.7% (95% CI, 97.5 to 99.4%), with a kappa value of 0.96 (95% CI, 0.83 to 1.00). The qPCR assay used in this study can be considered a reliable HPV assay that fulfills the clinical validation criteria defined for use in cervical cancer screening.Comparison of HPV test versus conventional and automation-assisted Pap screening as potential screening tools for preventing cervical cancer.To evaluate new techniques in primary cervical cancer screening programmes.Cross sectional pilot study.Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Helsinki University Hospital.Consecutive 2032 human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA and Pap smear samples were taken. Histological diagnoses were obtained from 460 patients.We compared the validity of the high risk (HR) HPV DNA detection test to automation-assisted and conventional Pap smear screening.Specificity and sensitivity of screening methods.Twenty-three percent of women were HPV positive. Forty-five of 46 had high grade lesions and cancers were HR HPV DNA positive, whereas 72/93 of low grade and more severe lesions were HR HPV DNA positive. When histologically verified high grade lesions were observed, the relative sensitivity of HR Hybrid Capture 2 (HR HC2) test was 98% compared with conventional Pap smear and Papnet tests, which performed 54%versus 58%, 83%versus 86% and 93%versus 98% relative sensitivity respectively, using cytological diagnoses HSIL (high grade squamous intraepithelial lesion), LSIL (low grade squamous intraepithelial lesion) or ASCUS (atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance) as the cutoff. The specificity of HC2 test (77-79%) was comparable with the ASCUS+ (ASCUS and more severe) cytology (68-79%), but lower when compared with LSIL+ (91-95%) or especially HSIL+ (97-99%) Pap smear results.Pap smear, as a screening test, is very different from HPV DNA detecting test HR HC 2. If cutoff LSIL or more severe lesions is used, primary Pap smear is clearly more specific than HR HC2, but markedly less sensitive. Due to high relative sensitivity of the HPV, only very few histologically confirmed high grade lesions would be detected among HPV negatives using simultaneous cytology. On the other hand, using HPV DNA test alone would lead to multifold amounts of referrals for colposcopy. A posterior Pap smear assessment among HPV positives might be helpful in increasing sensitivity and specificity of screening and defining those who need an immediate referral or treatment. We plan to incorporate primary HR HPV DNA test with posterior Pap smear reading of HPV positives into our ongoing randomised prospective multiarm trial evaluating new techniques in organised screening for cervical cancer in Finland.Evaluation of oncogenic human papillomavirus RNA and DNA tests with liquid-based cytology in primary cervical cancer screening: the FASE study.The APTIMA HPV Assay (AHPV) allows detection of 14 high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) RNA types in cervical specimens. Until present, the assay has been compared to HPV DNA tests only in triage settings. Herein, we compare AHPV with a DNA assay (Hybrid Capture 2; HC2) and liquid-based cytology (LBC; using PreservCyt ThinPrep liquid Pap) in a screening setting (French APTIMA screening evaluation [FASE] study). Women (N = 5,006) aged 20-65 were screened by gynecologists in 17 private practices in Paris, France. One cervical specimen was collected and tested with LBC, AHPV and HC2 assays. Women were referred to colposcopy if they were ASC-US+ in LBC or HPV positive in either HPV assay. To control for verification bias, a random group (14%) with normal LBC and dually HPV negative tests underwent colposcopy. Data from 4,429 women were analyzed. Sensitivity, specificity and predictive values were calculated for the three tests. AHPV and HC2 were highly sensitive for CIN2+ (92.0% and 96.7%) and CIN3+ (95.7% and 95.3%) detection and much more sensitive than LBC (69.1% for CIN2+ and 73.3% for CIN3+). Specificity of AHPV was higher than that of HC2, but similar to that of LBC (p < 0.001). Combining LBC with either HPV test slightly increased sensitivity but compromised specificity. AHPV assay is both specific and sensitive for the detection of high-grade precancerous lesions and may be considered as an option for routine cervical cancer screening for women over 20 years of age.Performance characteristics of Pap test, VIA, VILI, HR-HPV testing, cervicography, and colposcopy in diagnosis of significant cervical pathology.We sought to evaluate the performance of diagnostic tools to establish an affordable setting for early detection of cervical cancer in developing countries. We compared the performance of different screening tests and their feasibility in a cohort of over 12,000 women: conventional Pap smear, liquid-based cytology, visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA), visual inspection with Iodine solution (VILI), cervicography, screening colposcopy, and high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) testing (HR-HPV) collected by physician and by self-sampling. HR-HPV assay collected by the physician has the highest sensitivity (80 %), but high unnecessary referrals to colposcopy (15.1 %). HR-HPV test in self-sampling had a markedly lower (57.1 %) sensitivity. VIA, VILI, and cervicography had a poor sensitivity (47.4, 55, and 28.6 %, respectively). Colposcopy presented with sensitivity of 100 % in detecting CIN2+, but the lowest specificity (66.9 %). Co-testing with VIA and VILI Pap test increased the sensitivity of stand-alone Pap test from 71.6 to 87.1 % and 71.6 to 95 %, respectively, but with high number of unnecessary colposcopies. Co-testing with HR-HPV importantly increased the sensitivity of Pap test (to 86 %), but with high number of unnecessary colposcopies (17.5 %). Molecular tests adjunct to Pap test seems a realistic option to improve the detection of high-grade lesions in population-based screening programs.BD-ProExC as adjunct molecular marker for improved detection of CIN2+ after HPV primary screening.We investigated the efficacy of 8 cervical cancer screening strategies relative to cytology with emphasis on immunocytochemical detection of high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV)-induced cell transformation (BD-ProExC) as a tool of triage following primary cytology or hrHPV testing. 3,126 women were tested with BD-SurePath liquid-based cytology, hrHPV PCR genotyping and BD-ProExC immunostaining, and colposcopy verification to calculate sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV) in detecting cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN2(+)).Compared to cytology screening, double testing with cytology and hrHPV resulted in the same sensitivity with a significant increase in the PPV (relative PPV: 1.83). However, twice as many tests were needed. Cytology with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US) triage and hrHPV testing showed comparative results to double testing requiring only a small increase in number of tests. Screening for hrHPV subtypes 16/18, and ASC-US triage with hrHPV16/18 resulted in significant reductions in sensitivity (ratio: 0.74 and 0.96, respectively). Primary hrHPV/BD-ProExC screening was significantly more sensitive (ratio: 1.63/1.33), but had a significantly lower PPV (ratio: 0.64/0.88). ASC-US triage by BD-ProExC increased the PPV (ratio: 1.90) but decreased the sensitivity (ratio: 0.96). Primary hrHPV screening followed by BD-ProExC triage, led to significant increases in sensitivity (ratio: 1.30) and PPV (ratio: 2.89), and resulted in 55% fewer referrals for colposcopy.From the investigated screening strategies, primary hrHPV DNA-based screening followed by BD-ProExC triage was determined to be the best screening strategy.Immunocytological triage could be used to perfect hrHPV primary screening.Evaluation of a human papillomavirus assay in cervical screening in Zimbabwe.To determine the utility of an assay for high risk genital human papillomavirus (HPV) in cervical screening in Zimbabwe, Africa.Cross-sectional study.Harare, Zimbabwe.Zimbabwe women (n = 2,140), 25 to 55 years old, recruited in clinics in Chitungwiza and Greater Harare.Genital specimens were assessed for HPV, using the HPV DNA test Hybrid Capture II (probe B). Further assessment of the women was conducted using colposcopy and biopsy as indicated. High grade squamous intraepithelial lesions were diagnosed in 215 women. Colposcopy and/or biopsy showed low grade lesions in 346 women.The overall prevalences were: 42 x 7% for HPV, 10% for high grade squamous intraepithelial lesions and 16% for low grade lesions. Prevalence for HPV decreased significantly with increase in age (P for trend < 0 x 0001) and increased significantly with increasing disease severity, from 35% in normal women, to 53% in women with low grade lesions and 81% in women with high grade lesions (P for trend < 0 x 001). In specimens positive for HPV, the amount was 14-fold higher in women with high grade lesions compared with normal women. In screening for high grade lesions the assay for HPV had a sensitivity of 81% (CI 75%-86%); sensitivity for low grade lesions was 64% (CI 60%-68%). Specificity was 62% (CI 59%-64%) for high grade lesions and 65% (CI 62%-67%) for low grade lesions. The positive predictive value was 19% (CI 17%-22%) for high grade lesions and 39% (CI 36%-42%) for low grade lesions.For high grade squamous intraepithelial lesions the sensitivity of the Hybrid Capture II HPV DNA test was high, but the specificity was relatively low. The test may therefore be most useful in conjunction with other screening tests.Human papillomavirus testing in primary cervical screening.Several studies have examined the role of tests for human papillomavirus (HPV) in screening for cervical cancer but as yet the relevance is unclear. We looked at HPV testing for types 16, 18, 31, and 33 on material taken at the time of a cervical smear in 2009 eligible women having routine screening. Women with any degree of dyskaryosis or high levels of one of these HPV types were referred for colposcopy. 44% of the cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) lesions of grade 2/3 detected had negative cytology and were found only by HPV testing. A further 22% of the CIN 2/3 lesions were positive for HPV but showed only borderline or mild cytological changes. The positive predictive value of HPV testing was 42%, which was similar to that for moderate dyskaryosis. HPV types 16 and 31 were more sensitive and specific for CIN 2/3 than were types 18 or 33. However, 25% of the CIN 2/3 lesions were not detected by these four HPV tests. We suggest that HPV testing could usefully augment but not replace conventional cytology. These results should stimulate a much larger randomised trial to assess the impact of these improved CIN 2/3 detection rates on the subsequent incidence of invasive cancer.Incidence and outcome of acquisition of human papillomavirus infection in women with normal cytology--a population-based cohort study from Taiwan.Little is known about acquisition of human papillomavirus (HPV) and its outcome among older women with negative HPV testing and normal cytology. A longitudinal 3-yr follow-up of nested-cohort subjects (n = 8825) from a population-based cervical cancer screening study whose Pap and HPV tests were negative at baseline were conducted. Every active HPV-negative (n = 413) participant had 12-mo follow-ups of Pap smear and HPV testing. Colposcopy was performed if either HPV-positive or cytology was abnormal. The cytology and histology information of the remaining subjects (passive HPV-negative, n = 8412) was obtained from national registry database. Median age of participants was 45 yr (range, 30-73 yr). The incidence of new acquisition was 4.2/100 woman-years. The 3-yr cumulative total HPV acquisition rate was 11.1% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 8.1-14.1). Increased number of sexual partners (> or =2 vs. 1) of the participant was associated with risk of acquisition (odds ratio [OR]: 5.0, 95% CI: 2.0-12.6) by multivariate analysis. Three cases of > or = cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 2 were identified in 3-yr follow-up in active HPV-negative subjects. HPV genotypes in the dysplastic tissue were actually present at baseline samples after reanalysis. From the passive HPV-negative group, only 1 case progressed to CIN2 probably after HPV acquisition. Negative Pap and HPV tests assured a very low risk of developing > or = CIN2 within 3 yr despite incident HPV infection.A new HPV-DNA test for cervical-cancer screening in developing regions: a cross-sectional study of clinical accuracy in rural China.A new test (careHPV; QIAGEN, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) has been developed to detect 14 high-risk types of carcinogenic human papillomavirus (HPV) in about 2.5 h, to screen women in developing regions for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). We did a cross-sectional study to assess the clinical accuracy of careHPV as a rapid screening test in two county hospitals in rural China.From May 10 to June 15, 2007, the careHPV test was done locally by use of self-obtained vaginal and provider-obtained cervical specimens from a screening population-based set of 2530 women aged 30 to 54 years in Shanxi province, China. All women were assessed by visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA), Digene High-Risk HPV HC2 DNA Test (HC2), liquid-based cytology, and colposcopy with directed biopsy and endocervical curettage as necessary. In 2388 women with complete data, 441 women with negative colposcopy, but unsatisfactory or abnormal cytology or who were positive on HC2 or the new careHPV test, were recalled for a second colposcopy, four-quadrant cervical biopsies, and endocervical curettage. An absence of independence between the tests was not adjusted for and the Bonferroni correction was used for multiple comparisons.Complete data were available for 2388 (94.4%) women. 70 women had CIN2+ (moderate or severe CIN or cancer), of whom 23 had CIN3+. By use of CIN2+ as the reference standard and area-under-the-curve analysis with a two-sided alpha error level of 0.0083, the sensitivities and specificities of the careHPV test for a cut-off ratio cut-point of 0.5 relative light units, were 90.0% (95% CI 83.0-97.0) and 84.2% (82.7-85.7), respectively, on cervical specimens, and 81.4% (72.3-90.5) and 82.4% (80.8-83.9), respectively, on vaginal specimens (areas under the curve not significantly different, p=0.0596), compared with 41.4% (29.9-53.0) and 94.5% (93.6-95.4) for VIA (areas under the curve significantly different, p=0.0001 and p=0.0031, for cervical and vaginal-specimen comparisons for the careHPV test, respectively). The sensitivity and specificity of HC2 for cervical specimens were 97.1% (93.2-100) and 85.6% (84.2-87.1), respectively (areas under the curve not significantly different from the careHPV test on cervical specimens, p=0.0163).The careHPV test is promising as a primary screening method for cervical-cancer prevention in low-resource regions.Baseline cytology, human papillomavirus testing, and risk for cervical neoplasia: a 10-year cohort analysis.Annual Pap smear screening has been favored over less frequent screening in the United States to minimize the risk of cervical cancer. We evaluated whether simultaneous screening with a Pap test and human papillomavirus (HPV) testing is useful for assessing the risk for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 3 or cervical cancer.We enrolled 23 702 subjects in a study of HPV infection at Kaiser Permanente, Northwest Division, Portland, OR. Data were analyzed for 20 810 volunteers who were at least 16 years old (mean = 35.9 years) with satisfactory baseline Pap tests and suitable samples for HPV testing. Women were followed for up to 122 months (from April 1, 1989, to June 30, 1999) to determine the risk for histopathologically confirmed CIN3 or cancer.Among 171 women with CIN3 or cancer diagnosed over 122 months, 123 (71.9%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 65.2% to 78.7%) had baseline Pap results of atypical squamous cells or worse and/or a positive HPV test, including 102 (86.4%, 95% CI = 80.3% to 92.6%) of the 118 cases diagnosed within the first 45 months of follow-up. During this 45-month period, the cumulative incidence of CIN3 or cancer was 4.54% (95% CI = 3.61% to 5.46%) among women with a Pap test result of atypical squamous cells or worse, positive HPV tests, or both compared with 0.16% (95% CI = 0.08% to 0.24%) among women with negative Pap and HPV tests. Age, screening behavior, a history of cervical cancer precursors, and a history of treatment for CIN minimally affected results.Negative baseline Pap and HPV tests were associated with a low risk for CIN3 or cancer in the subsequent 45 months, largely because a negative HPV test was associated with a decreased risk of cervical neoplasia. Negative combined test results should provide added reassurance for lengthening the screening interval among low-risk women, whereas positive results identify a relatively small subgroup that requires more frequent surveillance.Liquid based cytology and HPV DNA testing in a Greek population compared to colposcopy and histology.Screening for cervical cancer in Greece is still unorganised and based on self- motivation. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of cytological findings from a large observational population sample, originating from Western Athens, in association with reflex DNA test, colposcopic estimation, and final histologic diagnosis. The rate of invasive carcinoma, both squamous cell and adenocarcinoma, is indicative of a largely unscreened population. In this study, the estimated overall prevalence of human papilloma virus (HPV) was 41.1%, with HPV positivity at 37.4% of cytologically normal women. HPV testing did not seem to improve sensitivity of cytology for atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US) and low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LGSIL) cases in identifying CIN 2+ lesions, but outperformed cytology in detecting CIN3+ for cytological high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HGSIL) cases. For HGSIL cases sensitivity of colposcopy for detecting CIN3+ was comparable to cytology.Diagnostic accuracy of self-collected human papillomavirus specimens as a primary screen for cervical cancer.The aim of the study was to compare the sensitivity of self-collected with clinician-collected human papillomavirus (HPV) tests and cytology for cervical cancer. A total of 250 non-pregnant, 25-60-year-old women from Leon, Nicaragua, self-collected vaginal specimens for HPV and received a pelvic examination for cytology and reflex HPV. All participants underwent colposcopy and completed questionnaires regarding demographic and medical information. The sensitivities of self-collected brushes, self-collected swabs and clinician-collected HPV tests were 25%, 16.7%, and 16.7%, respectively, with colposcopy as the gold standard and 30%, 22.2% and 40% when cytology was the gold standard. Agreement between self-collection methods was significant (κ=0.84, p<0.001). Although utilisation of colposcopy in every participant resulted in lower sensitivities, the self-collected tests surpassed cytology and significantly agreed with the clinician-collected results. Further clarification of the sensitivity will be required to employ self-collection for cervical cancer screening in low resource areas like rural Nicaragua.Improved sensitivity of vaginal self-collection and high-risk human papillomavirus testing.Self-collected vaginal specimens tested for high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) have been shown to be less sensitive for the detection of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia or cancer (≥CIN 3) than physician-collected endocervical specimens. To increase the sensitivity of self-collected specimens, we studied a self-sampling device designed to obtain a larger specimen from the upper vagina (POI/NIH self-sampler) and a more sensitive polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based HR-HPV assay. Women (10,000) were screened with cervical cytology and HR-HPV testing of vaginal self-collected and endocervical physician-collected specimens. Women were randomly assigned to use either a novel self-collection device (POI/NIH self-sampler) or conical-shaped brush (Qiagen). The self-collected and clinician-collected specimens were assayed by Cervista (Hologic) and the research only PCR-based matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF). Women with any abnormal screening test underwent colposcopy and biopsy. Women (8,556), mean age of 38.9, had complete data; 1.6% had ≥ CIN 3. For either HR-HPV assay, the sensitivity was similar for the two self-collection devices. Tested with Cervista, the sensitivity for ≥CIN 3 of self-collected specimens was 70.9% and for endocervical specimens was 95.0% (p = 0.0001). Tested with MALDI-TOF, the sensitivity for ≥CIN 3 of self-collected specimens was 94.3% and for endocervical specimens was also 94.3% (p = 1.0). A self-collected sample using a PCR-based assay with the capability of very high throughput has similar sensitivity as a direct endocervical specimen obtained by a physician. Large population-based screening "events" in low-resource settings could be achieved by promoting self-collection and centralized high-throughput, low-cost testing by PCR-based MALDI-TOF.Long-term follow-up of cervical disease in women screened by cytology and HPV testing: results from the HART study.Several studies have shown that testing for high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) types results in an improved sensitivity for CIN2+, compared with cytology, although with a somewhat lower specificity.We obtained follow-up results, with at least one smear after participation in the HART study, which compared HPV testing (HC-II) with cytology as a primary screening modality.With a median follow-up of 6 years, 42 additional cases of CIN2+ were identified; women who were HPV positive at baseline were more likely to develop CIN2+ than those who were HPV negative (hazard ratio (HR) 17.2; 95% confidence interval (CI) (9.3-31.6)) and the risk increased with increasing viral load. Compared with HPV-negative women (relative light unit (RLU) <1), the HR (95% CI) was 5.4 (1.6, 18.2) for 1-10 RLU and 25.5 (13.6, 47.9) for RLU > or = 10. Positive cytology (borderline or worse compared with negative) was also predictive of developing CIN2, although to a lesser extent (HR 8.7; 95% CI (4.5-17.1)). Only one case of CIN3 and three cases of CIN2 were found in women who showed a positive cytology result but were HPV negative at baseline.After 5 years of follow-up, CIN2+ occurred in 0.23% of women who were HPV negative at baseline compared with 0.48% of women who showed a negative cytology result, indicating a much longer low-risk interval for CIN2+ after HPV testing.A comprehensive evaluation of the accuracy of cervical pre-cancer detection methods in a high-risk area in East Congo.Given the high burden of cervical cancer in low-income settings, there is a need for a convenient and affordable method for detecting and treating pre-cancerous lesions.Samples for comparing the accuracy of cytology, virology and histology were collected. Identification of HPV E6/E7 mRNA was performed using PreTect HPV-Proofer. HPV DNA detection was performed by GP5+/6+ PCR, followed by reverse line blot (RLB) for typing.A total of 343 women, aged 25-60 years, attending gynaecological polyclinics in DR Congo were included for sample enrolment. The test positivity rate was conventional and liquid-based cytology (LBC) at cutoff ASCUS+ of 6.9 and 6.6%, respectively; PreTect HPV-Proofer of 7.3%; and consensus DNA PCR for 14 HR types of 18.5%. Sixteen cases of CIN2+ lesions were identified. Of these, conventional cytology identified 66.7% with a specificity of 96.2%, LBC identified 73.3% with a specificity of 96.9%, all at cutoff ASCUS+. HR-HPV DNA detected all CIN2+ cases with a specificity of 85.9%, whereas PreTect HPV-Proofer gave a sensitivity of 81.3% and a specificity of 96.6%.Both HPV detection assays showed a higher sensitivity for CIN2+ than did cytological methods. Detecting E6/E7 mRNA from only a subset of HR HPVs, as is the case with PreTect HPV-Proofer, resulted in a similar specificity to cytology and a significantly higher specificity than consensus HR HPV DNA (P<0.0001).Sensitivity, specificity, and clinical value of human papillomavirus (HPV) E6/E7 mRNA assay as a triage test for cervical cytology and HPV DNA test.There is evidence that testing for human papillomavirus (HPV) E6/E7 mRNA is more specific than testing for HPV DNA. A retrospective study was carried out to evaluate the performance of the PreTect HPV-Proofer E6/E7 mRNA assay (Norchip) as a triage test for cytology and HPV DNA testing. This study analyzed 1,201 women, 688 of whom had a colposcopy follow-up and 195 of whom had histology-confirmed high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia or worse (CIN2+). The proportion of positive results and the sensitivity and specificity for CIN2+ were determined for HPV mRNA in comparison to HPV DNA and cytology. All data were adjusted for follow-up completeness. Stratified by cytological grades, the HPV mRNA sensitivity was 83% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 63 to 94%) in ASC-US (atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance), 62% (95% CI = 47 to 75%) in L-SIL (low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion), and 67% (95% CI = 57 to 76%) in H-SIL (high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion). The corresponding figures were 99, 91, and 96%, respectively, for HPV DNA. The specificities were 82, 76, and 45%, respectively, for HPV mRNA and 29, 13, and 4%, respectively, for HPV DNA. Used as a triage test for ASC-US and L-SIL, mRNA reduced colposcopies by 79% (95% CI = 74 to 83%) and 69% (95% CI = 65 to 74%), respectively, while HPV DNA reduced colposcopies by 38% (95% CI = 32 to 44%) and by 15% (95% CI = 12 to 19%), respectively. As a HPV DNA positivity triage test, mRNA reduced colposcopies by 63% (95% CI = 60 to 66%), having 68% sensitivity (95% CI = 61 to 75%), whereas cytology at the ASC-US+ threshold reduced colposcopies by 23% (95% CI = 20 to 26%), showing 92% sensitivity (95% CI = 87 to 95%). In conclusion, PreTect HPV-Proofer mRNA can serve as a better triage test than HPV DNA to reduce colposcopy referral in both ASC-US and L-SIL. It is also more efficient than cytology for the triage of HPV DNA-positive women. Nevertheless, its low sensitivity demands a strict follow-up of HPV DNA positive-mRNA negative cases.Human papillomavirus testing and liquid-based cytology: results at recruitment from the new technologies for cervical cancer randomized controlled trial.Although testing for human papillomavirus (HPV) has higher sensitivity and lower specificity than cytology alone for detecting cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), studies comparing conventional and liquid-based cytology have had conflicting results.In the first phase of a two-phase multicenter randomized controlled trial, women aged 35-60 years in the conventional arm (n = 16,658) were screened using conventional cytology, and women in the experimental arm (n = 16,706) had liquid-based cytology and were tested for high-risk HPV types using the Hybrid Capture 2 assay. Women in the conventional arm were referred to colposcopy with atypical cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS) or higher and those in the experimental arm were referred with ASCUS or higher cytology or with a positive (> or = 1 pg/mL) HPV test. Sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV) for detection of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or higher (CIN2+) were calculated.The screening methods and referral criterion applied in the experimental arm had higher sensitivity than that in the conventional arm (relative sensitivity = 1.47; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.03 to 2.09) but a lower PPV (relative PPV = 0.40; 95% CI = 0.23 to 0.66). With HPV testing alone at > or = 1 pg/mL and at > or = 2 pg/mL, the gain in sensitivity compared with the conventional arm remained similar (relative sensitivity = 1.43, 95% CI = 1.00 to 2.04 and relative sensitivity = 1.41, 95% CI = 0.98 to 2.01, respectively) but PPV progressively improved (relative PPV = 0.58, 95% CI = 0.33 to 0.98 and relative PPV = 0.75, 95% CI = 0.45 and 1.27, respectively). Referral based on liquid-based cytology alone did not increase sensitivity compared with conventional cytology (relative sensitivity = 1.06; 95% CI = 0.72 to 1.55) but reduced PPV (relative PPV = 0.57; 95% CI = 0.39 to 0.82).HPV testing alone was more sensitive than conventional cytology among women 35-60 years old. Adding liquid-based cytology improved sensitivity only marginally but increased false-positives. HPV testing using Hybrid Capture 2 with a 2 pg/mL cutoff may be more appropriate than a 1 pg/mL cutoff for primary cervical cancer screening.High-risk human papilloma virus prevalence and its relation with abnormal cervical cytology among Turkish women.In this study we aimed to investigate high-risk human papilloma virus (hrHPV) prevalence among Turkish women. Cervical samples were collected from 501 women for cytological screening and hrHPV testing by Digene Hybrid Capture 2. hrHPV prevalence and its relation with cytological results and epidemiologic data were analysed by SPSS. The prevalence of hrHPV was 4.2% (21 of the 501 women). Women with abnormal cytological screening results have significantly higher risk of hrHPV positivity compared with women with normal cytological results (19% vs 3.5%) (p ≤ 0.01). The incidence of HPV infection was only associated with the number of sexual partners, but there was no association with age, contraception methods or age at the first sexual intercourse. The prevalence of hrHPV among histological-confirmed cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 1, CIN 2 and normal cases were found as 37.5%, 25% and 25%, respectively. The prevalence of cervical hrHPV infection is 4.2% in our population and this rate seems lower than reported rates from other regions. According to further studies with a larger sample size, reflex cytology based on hrHPV positivity should be considered for our national cervical cancer screening programme.Screening trial of human papillomavirus for early detection of cervical cancer in Santiago, Chile.Cervical cancer mortality in Chile is four times higher than in developed countries. We compared the accuracy of human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA testing and conventional Papanicolaou (Pap) testing to detect prevalent precancerous and cancerous lesions in the routine clinical practice of the public health system. Women aged 25 years and older residing in the area covered by three primary care centers of Santiago, Chile, were invited to participate. Eligible women received both HPV DNA (Hybrid Capture 2) and Pap testing. Women positive by either test (Pap: ASCUS+, HC2: RLU/CO ≥ 1.0) underwent colposcopy and biopsy, as did a sample of double-negative women with an abnormal cervix at visual inspection or with risk factors for cervical lesions. Crude and verification bias-corrected sensitivities and specificities were estimated. In total, 8,265 women (98.8% of eligible) had complete screening results. Of these, 10.7% were HPV positive, 1.7% were Pap positive and 1.1% were positive by both tests. In all, 931 (11.3%) women were screen-positive, of whom 94.3% attended colposcopy. Additionally, 295 control women were invited for colposcopy, of whom 78% attended. In all, 42 CIN2, 45 CIN3 and 9 cancers were identified. Verification bias-corrected sensitivity for CIN2+ (95% confidence interval) was 92.7% (84.4-96.8) for HPV and 22.1% (16.4-29.2) for Pap; corresponding specificities were 92.0% (91.4-92.6) and 98.9% (98.7-99.0). In conclusion, in routine clinical practice in a developing country, HPV testing was four times more sensitive for CIN2+ than Pap testing, identifying three times more CIN2+ lesions; HPV testing was easily implemented in our established cervical cancer prevention program.Shanxi Province cervical cancer screening study II: self-sampling for high-risk human papillomavirus compared to direct sampling for human papillomavirus and liquid based cervical cytology.The objective of this study was to compare the sensitivity and specificity of a new method for self-sampling for high risk human papillomavirus (HPV) with direct sampling and liquid based cervical cytology. In Shanxi Province, China, 8,497 women (ages 27-56) underwent a self-sample for HPV using a conical-shaped brush placed into the upper vagina and rotated. Three to sixteen months later the women were screened with liquid-based cytology and direct HPV tests. Subjects with any abnormal test underwent colposcopy and multiple biopsies. Mean age was 40.9 years. 4.4 percent of subjects had >or=CIN II, 26% a positive self-sample and 24% a positive direct test for HPV. The sensitivity for detection of >or=CIN II was 87.5% for self-sampling, and 96.8% for the direct test (P < 0.001). The specificity was 77.2% for the self-sample and 79.7% for the direct test. With an abnormal Pap defined as ASCUS or greater the sensitivity of the Pap for the detection of >CIN II was 88.3% and the specificity was 81.2%. We conclude that self-sampling for HPV is less sensitive for >CIN II than the direct test, but similar to liquid based cytology.Comparison of HPV-based assays with Papanicolaou smears for cervical cancer screening in Morelos State, Mexico.To compare the performance of human papillomavirus (HPV) assays with conventional Pap cytology for cervical cancer (CC) screening in Mexico.Pap smears, self-collected vaginal specimens (SS) for HPV testing, and clinician-collected cervical specimens (CS) for HPV testing were obtained from 7868 women, aged 15-85 years old, attending CC screening at the Mexican Institute of Social Security (IMSS) between May and October, 1999. SS and CS specimens were screened for oncogenic HPV DNA by Hybrid Capture 2. Women who received cytological interpretations of atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS), and/or a positive HPV test were referred for colposcopy and histologic studies. The relative estimates for sensitivity, specificity and predictive values of each test were calculated using histological diagnoses of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) grades 2 or 3, or CC histological diagnosis.Oncogenic HPV detection rate was 11.6% for SS, and 9.3% for CS. Pap smear abnormalities were observed in 2.4% of the women. Of 1147 women who had at least one abnormal test result, 88.5% underwent colposcopy, and 101 biopsy-confirmed CIN2/3 or cancer cases were identified. The relative sensitivity estimates for the Pap test, SS and CS were 59.4% (95% CI: 49.2-68.9), 71.3% (95% CI: 61.3-79.6), and 93.1% (95% CI: 85.8-96.9), respectively, while the specificities were 98.3% (95% CI: 98.0-98.6), 89.2% (95% CI: 88.5-89.9), and 91.8% (95% CI: 91.2-92.4), respectively. The positive predictive values of Pap, SS and CS were 36.1, 9.1 and 14.9, the colposcopy referrals needed to detect a case of CIN2/3 or cancer were 2.8, 11.0 and 6.7, respectively.Both HPV assays detected more cases of CIN2/3 or CC than Pap cytology alone. However, the HPV assays increased the number of colposcopy referrals. Our study suggests that HPV testing could be an effective way to improve the performance of CC screening.Evaluation of visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA), Lugol's iodine (VILI), cervical cytology and HPV testing as cervical screening tools in Latin America. This report refers to partial results from the LAMS (Latin AMerican Screening) study.To assess the performance indicators of visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA) and visual inspection with Lugol's iodine (VILI) in four Latin American centres participating in the ongoing Latin AMerican Screening (LAMS) study, in settings with moderate incidence of cervical disease and with poorly to moderately well-organized cervical cancer screening.Three Brazilian centres (São Paulo, Campinas and Porto Alegre) and one Argentine centre (Buenos Aires) recruited a total of 11,834 healthy women to undergo VIA, VILI, conventional Pap smear and Hybrid Capture II (HCII).Women who had a positive result from any of these tests were subjected to colposcopy and biopsies (if necessary), and women with high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) were properly treated. To control for verification bias, 5% of women with normal tests were referred for colposcopy, as were 20% of HCII-negative women.Data on VIA (n=11,834), VILI (n=2994), conventional Pap smear (n=10,138) and HCII (n=4195) were available for test comparisons, calculating sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values. Overall test positivity was 11.6% for VIA, 23.0% for VILI, 2.2% for Pap smear (LSIL threshold), 1.1% for Pap smear (HSIL threshold) and 17.1% for HCII. VIA was positive in 61.8% of the women with CIN 1, 57.0% of those with CIN 2, 35.0% of women with CIN 3 and in 21 of 28 (75%) of women with cancer. Approximately 10% of women with no detectable disease had an abnormal VIA. Regarding VILI, 83.3% of women diagnosed with CIN 1 and 62.5% of those with CIN 3 had an abnormal test. VILI failed to detect one of three cases of cancer. Both the sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value of VIA and VILI in detecting CIN 2 or CIN 3 could be significantly improved depending on the combination with Pap smear or HCII (sensitivity up to 100.0% and specificity up to 99.8%).The LAMS study failed to reproduce the performance figures obtained with VIA and VILI (as stand-alone tests) in some other settings, where the prevalence of cervical disease was higher. However, a combined use of VIA or VILI with the Pap test or HCII allowed specific detection of cervical abnormalities.Inclusion of HPV testing in routine cervical cancer screening for women above 29 years in Germany: results for 8466 patients.In a prospective cohort study 8466 women attending routine cervical cancer screening were recruited. Colposcopy was performed on women with any degree of atypia on cytology and/or a positive high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV)-DNA test (HC2; Hybrid Capture 2((c))), and for a randomly selected sample of 3.4% women with negative findings on both. Quality control included reviews of cytology, histology, colposcopy images and retesting of samples with polymerase chain reaction. Test diagnostic performances were based on 7908 women who had complete baseline and follow-up results. Routine histology identified 86 women with high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN2+), which was confirmed by review histology in only 46 cases. Sensitivity of routine cytology for the detection of CIN2+ was 43.5%, with a specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) of 98.0, 11.4 and 99.7%, respectively. Sensitivity of the HC2 test for the detection of CIN2+ was 97.8%, with a specificity, PPV and NPV, of 95.3, 10.9 and 100%, respectively. No high-grade neoplasia was detected in the randomly selected control group. A negative HPV-test result, even in combination with a positive Papanicolaou (Pap) result, virtually excluded any risk of underlying high-grade disease, but this was not the case for a negative Pap result. These data show that HPV testing is of value for the detection or exclusion of prevalent CIN in a routine cervical cancer-screening setting and could be used for further risk classification of women for follow-up management.Risk assessment and clinical impact of liquid-based cytology, oncogenic human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA and mRNA testing in primary cervical cancer screening (the FASE study).New commercial HPV RNA assays require further validation studies in population-based cervical cancer screening settings. To assess the performance of (FDA-approved) APTIMA® HPV Assay (AHPV), Hybrid Capture 2 (HC2), in-house PCR genotyping, and ThinPrep LBC in population-based screening, stratified by three histological gold standards.A multi-center trial in 5006 women undergoing routine screening in France was designed to compare the absolute and relative risks of diagnosing CIN3+ and CIN2+ lesions by different diagnostic tests.Reproducibility between the primary and second pathology reading was excellent for CIN3+ and CIN2+ endpoints (Cohen's kappa 0.948 and 0.854). Absolute risks (PPV) of different tests (AHPV, HC2, PCR genotyping, LBC) in diagnosing CIN2+ (15-20%) and CIN3+ (4-6%) were similar for the first, second, and consensus pathology readings. The relative risks of diagnosing these lesions by the four tests were also similar when the first, second or third pathology readings were employed. AHPV had the highest absolute risk of both histological endpoints, and detects 5% to 15% more CIN3+ and CIN2+ lesions, respectively, than LBC. Compared with HC2 assay, the relative risk of AHPV is 24% to 29% higher, with a significant difference in CIN2+ detection. With LBC as reference, AHPV had the best sensitivity/specificity balance measured by AUC (area under ROC curve) comparison test (significant for CIN2+), and the colposcopy referral rate (9.2%) comparable to that of LBC (8.7%).These data corroborate the suitability of AHPV for the primary cervical cancer screening.Accuracy of human papillomavirus testing in primary screening of cervical neoplasia: results from a multicenter study in India.The knowledge that cervical neoplasia are caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) infection has led to the evaluation of its role in screening. We evaluated the accuracy of HPV testing by Hybrid capture II (HC II) method in detecting cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 and 3 (CIN 2 and 3) lesions in 4 cross-sectional studies with common protocol and questionnaire in 3 different locations (Kolkata, Mumbai and Trivandrum) in India. These studies involved 18,085 women aged 25-65 years. The reference standard for final diagnosis was a combination of colposcopy/biopsy. All women were investigated with colposcopy and 3,116 received directed biopsy. The sensitivity of HPV testing for detecting CIN 2-3 lesions varied from 45.7% to 80.9% across the study sites; the specificity varied from 91.7% to 94.6% and the positive predictive value from 6.7% to 13.7%. Retesting of 298 randomly chosen denatured samples in France revealed an agreement rate of 85.9% and a kappa-value of 0.72. Although HPV testing seems to be a promising approach for cervical cancer prevention, a large range in sensitivity was observed in our study, possibly due to variations in the quality of specimen collection and reference standards. A higher sensitivity was associated with the center performing the test well. Further developments in terms of more reproducible, less expensive and less sophisticated testing are essential to make the test feasible and effective in low-resource settings.CareHPV cervical cancer screening demonstration in a rural population of north India.To compare cervical careHPV screening in a rural community setting with other methods of cervical screening for the detection of high-grade cervical intra-epithelial neoplasia (CIN).Cross-sectional study. All ever-married women aged 30-59 years surveyed in an administrative area of Uttar Pradesh, India were targeted for screening by careHPV (cervical and vaginal samples), Pap test and visual inspection of the cervix following application of acetic acid (VIA). Women who screened positive were referred for colposcopy and the results were confirmed histologically. Sensitivity, specificity and predictive values for the detection of histological CINII+ and CINIII+ were assessed for each screening test.Sixty-five percent (5032/7704) of the women invited for cervical screening agreed to participate in the study. Screen-positive rates for cervical careHPV, vaginal careHPV, Pap test and VIA were 3%, 2%, 3% and 6%, respectively. Data for women who did not complete all screening modes, women lost to follow-up and women with missing histological results were excluded before data analysis, resulting in a final sample size of 4658. Cervical careHPV had high sensitivity (85%) for the detection of CINIII+ lesions and moderate sensitivity (53%) for the detection of CINII+ lesions. Sensitivities for the detection of CINIII+ and CINII+ were 54% and 41% for vaginal careHPV, 62% and 44% for Pap test, and 8% and 22% for VIA, respectively.Cervical careHPV testing is superior to VIA and Pap test for the detection of high-grade CIN in a rural community setting.Screening for high-grade cervical intra-epithelial neoplasia and cancer by testing for high-risk HPV, routine cytology or colposcopy.The validity of testing for high-risk types of human papillomavirus (HPV) in cervical cancer prevention programs is undetermined. We compared the performance on primary screening of HPV DNA testing, cytology and colposcopy in detecting cervical intra-epithelial neoplasia (CIN) grade 2 or 3 or cancer. A cohort of 4,761 women, median age 35 years, was screened by routine cytology, routine colposcopy and testing for high-risk HPV by a PCR-based method. Within an 8-month period, women with abnormal findings on cytology or screening colposcopy or in whom high-risk HPV types were detected were referred for colposcopy and biopsy. Women negative on all initial screening tests were followed by a second screening examination. To correct for work-up bias, the true prevalence of CIN 2 or 3 or cancer was estimated by projection from histologically verified subgroups. Cervical biopsies were taken in 364 women (7.6%), of whom 114 (2.4%) showed CIN 2 (n = 34) or CIN 3 (n = 71) or cancer (n = 9). High-risk HPV testing achieved bias-corrected performance measures of 89.4% sensitivity, 93.9% specificity, 35.8% positive predictive value and 99.6% negative predictive value. Bias-corrected rates of true- and false-positives by high-risk HPV testing compared to cytology (colposcopy) were about 4.5 (6.7) and 19.1 (7.4) times higher, respectively. The quality of routine cytology was controlled by computer-assisted review, and the observed number of true-positives more than doubled after adding automated review results. In middle-aged women, testing for high-risk HPV types, particularly when negative, may be used to increase the screening interval in programs for secondary prevention of cervical cancer.Human papillomavirus messenger RNA assay for cervical cancer screening: the Shenzhen Cervical Cancer Screening Trial I.Testing for high-risk types of human papillomavirus (HPV) has been consistently more sensitive than cervical cytology for high-grade precancers and cancers of the cervix (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or higher) but less specific. New assays are being developed to improve on the overall accuracy of molecular testing. The Gen-Probe APTIMA HPV assay (AHPV) is a multiplex assay that qualitatively detects 14 HPV types in a single tube. Because the AHPV targets HPV-E6/E7 messenger RNA transcripts, it should theoretically have a greater specificity than HPV assays that detect HPV DNA. The objective of this study was to compare the sensitivity and the specificity of the Gen-Probe AHPV with those of the Qiagen Hybrid Capture 2 assay (HC2) and liquid-based cytologic examination for cervical cancer screening.A total of 2098 unscreened or poorly screened women 25 to 59 years of age were recruited in the city of Shenzhen, China. Two cervical specimens were collected: 1 in SurePath liquid for cytologic examination and 1 in PreservCyt for HPV testing by HC2 and the AHPV. The testing was performed by blinded technicians according to the manufacturer's instructions. Women who had atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance or worse cytologic diagnosis and/or were HPV positive by either assay were asked to return for colposcopy and biopsy.Overall, 2095 women had complete data. Overall, 16.5% of the women were positive on HC2, 10.1% were positive on the AHPV, 5.45% had atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance or greater on cytologic examination, and 1.4% had histologically confirmed cervical disease: cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or higher. The sensitivity values of liquid-based cytologic examination, HC2, and the AHPV were 66.7%, 88.9%, and 100%, respectively. The specificity values were 95.5%, 84.5%, and 91.2%, respectively. The AHPV was significantly more accurate by receiver operating characteristic curve comparison (P = 0.005).The low false-positive rate (high specificity) and the high sensitivity of the AHPV makes this assay suitable for use as a primary assay for detecting cervical disease in a screening setting.The study of the combination detection of HPV-DNA and p16INK4a in cervical lesions.The objective of this study is to detect the infection of human papillomavirus (HPV) and the expression of p16(INK4a) in cervical lesions and to investigate the interaction between hrHPV and p16(INK4a) for cervical lesions and its diagnostic efficiency. hrHPV-DNA was detected by the hybrid capture II (HC-II) system. Immunochemical method was used to detect the expression of p16(INK4a), and histopathologic test was performed to identify cervical lesions. χ(2) test and Spearman's rank correlation were used for statistical analysis. Additive effects model was used to analyze the interaction. The diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive values, negative predictive values, accuracy, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve were calculated with SPSS 13.0. hrHPV and p16(INK4a) positive rate increased (P < 0.05) with histopathologic diagnosis increasing. The positive rates of hrHPV and p16(INK4a) in negative or chronic inflammation were statistically lower than that in cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN)1, CIN2, CIN3, and squamous-cell carcinoma (SCC) (P < 0.05), respectively. There was a positive interaction between hrHPV and p16(INK4a), relative excess risk of interaction (RERI) was 52.49, attributable proportions of interaction (API) were 72.34%, and the synergy index (S) was 3.75. The specificity and AUC of combining hrHPV with p16(INK4a) were statistically higher than hrHPV or p16(INK4a) alone (P < 0.05). hrHPV and p16(INK4a) are useful markers for the early diagnosis of cervical lesions. A positive interaction between hrHPV and p16(INK4a) is seen. The combination of hrHPV and p16(INK4a) has a higher diagnostic accuracy than hrHPV or p16(INK4a) alone in diagnosis of cervical lesions.Human papillomavirus testing for primary screening in women at low risk of developing cervical cancer. The Greek experience.To compare the performance of human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA detection against routine Papanicolaou smear for the detection of low- and high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia in a low-risk population.A cross-sectional study was performed involving 1296 women attending six outpatient clinics in Northern Greece (Thessaloniki, Thermi, Mihaniona, Corfu, Veria, and Serres). Women underwent a gynecological examination, including collection of exfoliated cervical cells for Papanicolaou cytology and HPV DNA detection. Cytology was processed according the conventional routine manner, and HPV DNA was determined using the polymerase chain reaction technique. In positive cases of either method, a complete colposcopic evaluation was performed with directed biopsies. Tests (HPV DNA, cytology, and colposcopy) performance characteristics were determined using the histopathologic diagnosis as the reference standard.HPV DNA testing showed a significantly better sensitivity than the Papanicolaou smear in detecting cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (75% versus 50% for high-grade lesions and 81.2% versus 50% for lesions of any grade, respectively). Specificity, and positive and negative predictive values did not significantly differ. Even after dividing women in younger or older than 30 years, the sensitivity of the HPV DNA test was greater than cytology (100% and 70% versus 50% for cytology in both groups, respectively), with a 6.3% loss in specificity when performed in women younger than 30 years.HPV testing could be useful in screening women at low risk for cervical cancer, either as an adjunct tool to augment existing cytology programs or as a unique test of its own.Prior knowledge of HPV status improves detection of CIN2+ by cytology screening.The objective of the study was to investigate whether knowledge of human papillomavirus (HPV) deoxyribonucleic acid test results increases sensitivity of guided cytology screening for the detection of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN)-2 or higher-grade cervical lesions.This was a prospective colposcopy-controlled study of 2905 BD SurePath samples to identify cases with CIN2+ within a 24 month follow-up period. Sensitivity and specificity to detect CIN2+ was evaluated, comparing guided cytology screening with and without prior knowledge of HPV status.Prior knowledge of HPV status resulted in significantly higher detection rate of CIN2+ compared with screening blinded to HPV status (P = .005) with limited loss of specificity (P = .026). Gain in sensitivity is higher in older women (43.8%, P = .008) vs in younger women (10.2%, P = .317), whereas loss of specificity is more pronounced in younger women (P < .001) vs older women (P = .729).Guided cytological screening performed with prior knowledge of HPV status results in an improved detection of CIN2 or higher-grade lesions.Performance of carcinogenic human papillomavirus (HPV) testing and HPV16 or HPV18 genotyping for cervical cancer screening of women aged 25 years and older: a subanalysis of the ATHENA study.The ATHENA study was designed to assess the performance of carcinogenic human papillomavirus (HPV) testing and HPV16 or HPV18 genotyping compared with liquid-based cytology for cervical cancer screening in a large US population aged 21 years and older. We did a subanalysis of this population to compare the screening performance of the cobas HPV test versus liquid-based cytology in women aged 25 years and older, and assess management strategies for HPV-positive women.Women aged 25 years or older who were attending routine cervical screening were enrolled from 61 clinical centres in 23 US states. Cervical specimens were obtained for liquid-based cytology and HPV DNA testing with two first-generation assays (Amplicor HPV test and Linear Array HPV genotyping test) and the second-generation cobas HPV test (with individual HPV16 and HPV18 detection). Colposcopy and diagnostic biopsies were done on women with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US) or worse cytology, those who tested positive with either first-generation HPV test, and a random sample of women who tested negative for HPV and cytology. All women not selected for colposcopy received their results and exited the study. Participants and colposcopists were masked to cytology and HPV test results until the colposcopy visit was completed. The primary endpoint for this substudy was histologically confirmed cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 (CIN3) or worse. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00709891; the study is in the follow-up phase, which is due to be completed in December, 2012.From May 27, 2008, to Aug 27, 2009, 47,208 women were enrolled, of whom 41,955 met our eligibility criteria. Valid cobas HPV and liquid-based cytology test results were available for 40,901 women (97%), who were included in this analysis. Of these, 4275 women (10%) tested cobas HPV positive and 2617 (6%) had abnormal cytology. 431 women were diagnosed with CIN2 or worse and 274 with CIN3 or worse. In women who had colposcopy, the cobas HPV test was more sensitive than liquid-based cytology for detection of CIN3 or worse (252/274 [92·0%, 95% CI 88·1-94·6] vs 146/274 [53·3%, 95% CI 47·4-59·1]; difference 38·7%, 95% CI 31·9-45·5; p<0·0001). Addition of liquid-based cytology to HPV testing increased sensitivity for CIN3 or worse to 96·7% (265/274, 95% CI 93·9-98·3), but increased the number of screen positives by 35·2% (5783/40,901 vs 4275/40,901) compared with HPV testing alone. As a triage test to identify CIN3 or worse in HPV-positive women, detection of HPV16, HPV18, or both alone was equivalent to detection of ASC-US or worse alone in terms of sensitivity (150/252 [59·5%] vs 133/252 [52·8%]; p=0·11) and positive predictive value (PPV) (150/966 [15·5%] vs 133/940 [14·1%]; p=0·20). Among HPV-positive women, detection of HPV16, HPV18, or both or low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion or worse cytology had better sensitivity (182/252 [72·2%]; p<0·0001) and similar PPV (182/1314 [13·9%]; p=0·70) for detection of CIN3 or worse than ASC-US or worse cytology alone. Furthermore, detection of HPV16, HPV18, or both or high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion or worse cytology had higher sensitivity (165/252 [65·5%]; p=0·0011) and PPV (165/1013 [16·3%]; p=0·031) for detection of CIN3 or worse than ASC-US or worse cytology alone.HPV testing with separate HPV16 and HPV18 detection could provide an alternative, more sensitive, and efficient strategy for cervical cancer screening than do methods based solely on cytology.Roche Molecular Systems.HPV testing in primary screening of older women.Certain types of the human papilloma virus (HPV) are well established as the primary cause of cervical cancer. Several studies have shown that HPV testing can improve the detection rate of high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), but these have been carried out primarily in younger women. In this study we evaluated the role of HPV testing as an adjunct to cytology in women aged 35 or over. An additional aim was to evaluate commercially available kits for HPV testing. A total of 2988 eligible women aged 34 or more attending for a routine smear in 40 general practitioner practices received HPV testing in addition to routine cytology, after having given written informed consent. Samples were assayed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and two versions of the Hybrid Capture test for HPV, and women were invited for colposcopy if there was any cytological abnormality (including borderline smears) or the PCR test was positive. Any apparent abnormality was biopsied and loop-excision was performed as necessary. CIN was judged by histology; 42 women had high-grade CIN, of which six were cytology negative (86% sensitivity for borderline or worse) and three had a borderline smear (79% sensitivity for mild dyskaryosis or worse). The positive predictive value of a borderline smear was only 3.1%. Eleven high-grade lesions were negative by the PCR HPV test (sensitivity 74%). The first generation Hybrid Capture II test had a similar sensitivity but an unacceptably high false positive rate (18.3%), while the newer Hybrid Capture II microtitre kit had a 95% sensitivity and a 2.3% positivity rate in normal women when used at a 2 pg ml(-1) cut-off (positive predictive value 27%). Cytology performed very well in this older cohort of women. The newer Hybrid Capture II microtitre test may be a useful adjunct, especially if the results reported here are reproducible in other studies. A combined screening test offers the possibility of greater protection and/or longer screening intervals, which could reduce the overall cost of the screening programme.Impact of improved classification on the association of human papillomavirus with cervical precancer.Misclassification of exposure and surrogate endpoints of disease can obscure causal relations. Using data from the Atypical Squamous Cells of Undetermined Significance/Low-Grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesion Triage Study (ALTS, 1997-2001), the authors explored the impact of exposure (human papillomavirus (HPV) detection) and endpoint (histologic cervical precancer) classification on their mutual association. Women referred into this study with an atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance Papanicolaou test with satisfactory results for all 4 HPV tests were included in this analysis (n = 3,215; 92.2%). HPV testing results were related to different definitions of cervical precancer, based on paired, worst 2-year histologic diagnoses, by calculating clinical sensitivity, specificity, and odds ratios. The authors found that HPV test sensitivity increased and specificity decreased with increasing certainty of cervical precancer, with HPV testing having the highest sensitivity (92%-98%) and lowest specificity (46%-54%) for consensus cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 (CIN 3). The overall accuracy of each HPV test, as measured by odds ratios, was greatest for consensus CIN-3 diagnoses, from 2- to 4-fold greater than for a less stringent precancer definition of any diagnosis of CIN 2 or more severe. In summary, there was convergence of greater certainty of carcinogenic HPV with greater certainty of a precancerous diagnosis, such that all 4 HPV tests almost always tested positive in women most likely to have cervical precancer. Finding increasingly strong associations when both test and diagnostic misclassification are reduced is a useful sign of "true association" in molecular epidemiology.Significance of high-risk human papillomavirus detection by polymerase chain reaction in primary cervical cancer screening.The purposes of this study were to evaluate the incidence of high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) infection by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and to assess its diagnostic usefulness in primary cervical screening. PCR testing for HPV type 16, 18, 31 and 33 was performed on 1305 specimens obtained during routine cervical cancer screening. We analysed the concurrent cervical smears and biopsy, and correlated them with the HPV infection status. We also evaluated histologically-proven cases with ASCUS smears according to HPV infection. HPV DNA was identified in eight (0.7%) of 1144 cytologically normal patients; nine (10.5%) of 86 ASCUS; seven (25.0%) of 28 LSIL; 26 (78.8%) of 33 HSIL; and in all of three squamous cell carcinomas (SCC). HPV positivity was significantly associated with cytohistological diagnosis for HSIL of more. In addition, HPV-positive ASCUS cases were found to be associated with histological abnormality rather than HPV-negative. The results indicate that high-risk HPV testing by PCR could be a useful adjunct tool for Pap smear in primary cervical screening. The combination of Pap smear and high-risk HPV testing by PCR might reduce unnecessary colposcopy-guided biopsy of women with cytological diagnosis of ASCUS.Performance of high-risk human papillomavirus DNA testing as a primary screen for cervical cancer: a pooled analysis of individual patient data from 17 population-based studies from China.Controversy remains over whether high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA testing should be used as a primary screen for cervical cancer. The aims of our study were to assess whether HPV DNA testing could be applied to cervical-cancer screening programmes in China, as well as other similar developing countries.We did a pooled analysis of population-based cervical cancer screening studies done in mainland China from 1999 to 2008 with concurrent HPV DNA testing (Hybrid Capture 2 assay; Qiagen, Gaithersburg, MD, USA), liquid-based cytology (LBC), and visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA). Eligible women were sexually active, not pregnant, had an intact uterus, and had no history of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), cervical cancer, or pelvic irradiation. All women positive for any test were referred for colposcopy and biopsy. Cervical lesions were diagnosed by directed or random biopsy. We assessed the diagnostic accuracy of HPV DNA testing for the detection of CIN grade 3 or greater.30,371 women from 17 cross-sectional, population-based studies in various parts of China were screened. 1523 women were subsequently excluded because of inadequate HPV DNA specimens or they did not have a biopsy taken, which included women with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance; low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion or worse; positive HPV, negative cytology, and missing or positive colposcopy results; and unsatisfactory cytology results. HPV DNA testing had a higher sensitivity of 97·5% (95% CI 95·7-98·7) for detection of CIN grade 3 or worse, and a lower specificity of 85·1% (82·3-87·9), compared with cytology (sensitivity 87·9% [95% CI 84·7-90·7], specificity 94·7% [93·5-96·0]) and VIA (54·6% [48·0-61·2], 89·9% [86·8-93·0]). Sensitivity did not vary by study or age (<35 years, 35-49 years, ≥50 years); however, specificity did vary with age (p<0·0001) and was highest in women younger than 35 years (89·4%; 95% CI 86·1-91·5). An increase in the positive cutoff point from the manufacturer recommended 1 pg/mL to 2 pg/mL led to a decrease in the overall HPV DNA positivity from 16·3% to 13·9% (p<0·0001), which could result in a decrease in referral rates, although sensitivity was slightly lower (97·5% to 95·2%). An increase in the cutoff point to 10 pg/mL in women younger than 35 years maintained a high sensitivity 97·7% (95% CI 87·7-99·9) and increased specificity to 93·5% (95% CI 91·9-94·6).HPV DNA testing is highly sensitive and moderately specific for CIN grade 3 or worse, with consistent results across study sites and age groups-including women younger than 35 years. A rise in the cutoff point might be beneficial for future screening programmes in China, especially when screening women younger than 35 years.Management of women who test positive for high-risk types of human papillomavirus: the HART study.Certain types of human papillomavirus (HPV) are the primary cause of almost all cervical cancers. HPV testing of cervical smears is more sensitive but less specific than cytology for detecting high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN2+). HPV testing as a primary screening approach requires efficient management of HPV-positive women with negative or borderline cytology. We aimed to compare the detection rate and positive predictive values of HPV assay with cytology and to determine the best management strategy for HPV-positive women.We did a multicentre screening study of 11085 women aged 30-60 years. Women with borderline cytology and women positive for high-risk HPV with negative cytology were randomised to immediate colposcopy or to surveillance by repeat HPV testing, cytology, and colposcopy at 12 months.HPV testing was more sensitive than borderline or worse cytology (97.1% vs 76.6%, p=0.002) but less specific (93.3% vs 95.8%, p<0.0001) for detecting CIN2+. Of 825 randomised women, surveillance at 12 months was as effective as immediate colposcopy. In women positive for HPV at baseline, who had surveillance, 73 (45%) of 164 women with negative cytology and eight (35%) of 23 women with borderline cytology were HPV negative at 6-12 months. No CIN2+ was found in these women, nor in women with an initial negative HPV test with borderline (n=211) or mild (32) cytology.HPV testing could be used for primary screening in women older than 30 years, with cytology used to triage HPV-positive women. HPV-positive women with normal or borderline cytology (about 6% of screened women) could be managed by repeat testing after 12 months. This approach could potentially improve detection rates of CIN2+ without increasing the colposcopy referral rate.Application of human papillomavirus in screening for cervical cancer and precancerous lesions.Cervical cancer is a commonly-encountered malignant tumor in women. Cervical screening is particularly important due to early symptoms being deficient in specificity. The main purpose of the study is to assess the application value of cervical thinprep cytologic test (TCT) and human papillomavirus (HPV) detection in screening for cervical cancer and precancerous lesions. In the study, cervical TCT and HPV detection were simultaneously performed on 12,500 patients selected in a gynecological clinic. Three hundred patients with positive results demonstrated by cervical TCT and/or HPV detection underwent cervical tissue biopsy under colposcopy, and pathological results were considered as the gold standard. The results revealed that 200 out of 12,500 patients were abnormal by TCT, in which 30 cases pertained to equivocal atypical squamous cells (ASCUS), 80 cases to low squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL), 70 cases to high squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) and 20 cases to squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). With increasing pathological grade of cervical biopsy, however, TCT positive rates did not rise. Two hundred and eighty out of 12,500 patients were detected as positive for HPV infection, in which 50 cases were chronic cervicitis and squamous metaplasia, 70 cases cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) I, 60 cases CIN II, 70 cases CIN III and 30 cases invasive cervical carcinoma. Two hundred and thirty patients with high-risk HPV infection were detected. With increase in pathological grade, the positive rate of high-risk HPV also rose. The detection rates of HPV detection to CIN III and invasive cervical carcinoma as well as the total detection rate of lesions were significantly higher than that of TCT. Hence, HPV detection is a better method for screening of cervical cancer at present. Comparison of pap smear, visual inspection with acetic acid, human papillomavirus DNA-PCR testing and cervicography.To assess the test qualities of four screening methods to detect cervical intra-epithelial neoplasia in an urban African setting.Six hundred fifty-three women, attending a family planning clinic in Nairobi (Kenya), underwent four concurrent screening methods: pap smear, visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA), PCR for high risk human papillomavirus (HR HPV) and cervicography. The presence of cervical intra-epithelial neoplasia (CIN) was verified by colposcopy or biopsy.Sensitivity (for CIN2 or higher) and specificity (to exclude any CIN or cancer) were 83.3% (95% CI [73.6, 93.0]) and 94.6% (95% CI [92.6, 96.5]), respectively, for pap smear; 73.3% (95% CI [61.8, 84.9]) and 80.0% (95% CI [76.6, 83.4]) for VIA; 94.4% (95% CI [84.6, 98.8]) and 73.9% (95% CI [69.7, 78.2]) for HR HPV; and 72.3% (95% CI [59.1, 85.6]) and 93.2% (95% CI [90.8, 95.7]) for cervicography.The pap smear had the highest specificity (94.6%) and HPV testing the highest sensitivity (94.4%). The visual methods, VIA and cervicography, were similar and showed an accuracy in between the former two tests.Prevalence of high-risk human papillomavirus types and cervical squamous intraepithelial lesions in women over 30 years of age in St. Petersburg, Russia.Cytology-based screening has significantly decreased incidence of and mortality from cervical cancer. High sensitivity of high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) test for the detection of high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) makes it a useful screening tool, especially in settings where cytology is not available or not quality assured. The study aimed to determine the prevalence of hrHPV and associated cervical lesions in Russian women over 30 years of age and to assess usefulness of HPV test for cervical screening in Russia.Consecutive women aged 30-65 years (n=823) receiving routine gynaecological care, not pregnant and not treated for high-grade CIN, were recruited. Oncogenic HPV types were detected using Hybrid Capture 2 (HC2) assay and genotyped with direct DNA sequencing. Women with cytological abnormalities higher than atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS) and women positive for hrHPV were referred to colposcopy.HPV infection was present in 107 (13%) women. Cytological abnormalities were found in 81 (9.8%) patients, including 59 (7.2%) with ASCUS, 21 (2.5%) with low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL), and one (0.1%) with high-grade SIL. Only 11 (18.6%) patients with ASCUS were positive for hrHPV. Histological diagnoses were obtained for 63 women. Relative sensitivities and positive predictive values of the HPV test and cytology for the detection of high-grade CIN were 100% (6/6) and 9.5% (6/63), and 83.3% (5/6) and 27.8% (5/18), respectively. The most prevalent hrHPV types were 16 (3.9%), 31 (2.8%), 52 (1.7%), and 33 (1.3%). Cytological abnormalities and symptoms of a urogenital infection were strongly associated with hrHPV infection.The study provides data on the prevalence of hrHPV types in association with cervical lesions, as well as on hrHPV determinants, in an unvaccinated population of Russian women. Our results indicate that HPV test might be a useful screening tool in Russia.Head-to-Head Comparison of the RNA-Based Aptima Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Assay and the DNA-Based Hybrid Capture 2 HPV Test in a Routine Screening Population of Women Aged 30 to 60 Years in Germany.Testing for E6/E7 mRNA in cells infected with high-risk (HR) human papillomavirus (HPV) might improve the specificity of HPV testing for the identification of cervical precancerous lesions. Here we compared the RNA-based Aptima HPV (AHPV) assay (Hologic) and the DNA-based Hybrid Capture 2 (HC2) HPV test (Qiagen) to liquid-based cytology (LBC) for women undergoing routine cervical screening. A total of 10,040 women, 30 to 60 years of age, were invited to participate in the study, 9,451 of whom were included in the analysis. Specimens were tested centrally by LBC, the AHPV test, and the HC2 test, and women who tested positive on any test were referred for colposcopy. Genotyping was performed on all HR-HPV-positive samples. Test characteristics were calculated based on histological review. As a result, we identified 90 women with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2+ (CIN2+), including 43 women with CIN3+. Sensitivity differences between the AHPV test and the HC2 test in detecting CIN2+ (P = 0.180) or CIN3+ (P = 0.0625) lesions were statistically nonsignificant. Of three CIN3 cases that were missed with the AHPV test, two cases presented lesion-free cones and one had a non-HR HPV67 infection. The specificity (<CIN2) and positive predictive value (CIN2+) of the AHPV test were significantly higher (both P < 0.001) than those of the HC2 test. The overall agreement between the tests was substantial (κ = 0.77). Finally, we present results for several possible triage strategies, based on the primary screening test being either the AHPV test or the HC2 test. In summary, the AHPV assay is both specific and sensitive for the detection of high-grade precancerous lesions and may be used in primary cervical cancer screening for women ≥30 years of age. Quantification of intracellular HPV E6/E7 mRNA expression increases the specificity and positive predictive value of cervical cancer screening compared to HPV DNA.Current methods for HPV screening rely on the detection of L1 DNA from high risk genotypes (HRHPV). These assays have very high negative predictive values (~99%), however, the specificity and positive predictive value of HPV DNA tests for pre-cancerous and cancerous lesions (CIN 2+) is less than 50%. The purpose of this study was to compare HPV DNA with intracellular HPV E6, E7 mRNA quantification in an effort to improve the performance of cervical cancer screening.Liquid-based cervical cytology specimens collected in either PreservCyt or SurePath were processed for routing cytology, HPV HRDNA detection by Hybrid Capture 2 and HPV E6, E7 mRNA quantification in cells using the same sample. We analyzed a total of 2049 samples including 73 with CIN 2, CIN 3, or squamous cell carcinoma by biopsy and 1694 samples from women with normal cytology.The positive predictive value of HPV E6, E7 mRNA quantification in cells for CIN2+ was 78% which was greater than HPV DNA alone (43%). The specificity of HPV E6, E7 mRNA quantification was 96% based on normal cytology compared to 82% for HC2 while the specificity of HPV E6, E7 mRNA quantification based on CIN 2- histology was 85% compared to 35% for HC2.With similar sensitivity and greater specificity/positive predictive value, HPV E6, E7 mRNA quantification in cells is an improvement over HPV DNA for cervical cancer screening.A population-based study on the risks of cervical lesion and human papillomavirus infection among women in Beijing, People's Republic of China.Few population-based studies have investigated premalignant and malignant cervical abnormalities in Beijing.A total of 6,385 randomly selected sexually active women were interviewed and examined. Cervical lesion was diagnosed using cytology and histology. High-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) was detected by the second-generation hybrid capture test and typed by gene chip of DNA from paraffin-embedded tissue.The cervical lesion prevalence diagnosed by histology was 5.8%. High-risk HPV overall prevalence was 9.9%, 50.5% with cervical lesion and 7.4% without cervical lesion. High-risk HPV DNA load increased with increasing degree of lesions. HPV 16 was the most common type (26.5%) among women with cervical lesion, followed by HPV 58 (8.8%), HPV 33 (7.8%), and HPV 56 (5.3%). Women under 50 years of age, married status, pregnancy and delivery status, couple's sexual behavior, contraceptive history, columnar ectopy, and bacterial vaginosis or trichomonas vaginitis history were more risk factors for HPV infection. Factors for cervical lesion were similar, but in comparison with HPV infection, all associations were weakened. Only middle-aged women, husband's sexual partners, oral contraceptives, columnar ectopy, and history of trichomonas vaginitis remained associated with cervical lesion.In Beijing, the prevalence of cervical lesion and high-risk HPV is higher than estimated in previous reports. HPV 16, 58, and 33 were the most prevalent types. This is relevant for work related to cervical cancer vaccination.The study was conducted to understand the current status and epidemiologic characteristics of women with cervical lesion and HPV infection in Beijing.Cervical cancer risk for women undergoing concurrent testing for human papillomavirus and cervical cytology: a population-based study in routine clinical practice.Concurrent testing for human papillomavirus (HPV) and cervical cytology (co-testing) is an approved alternative to cytology alone in women aged 30 years and older. We aimed to assess the safety in routine clinical practice of 3-year screening intervals for women testing negative for HPV with normal cytology and to assess if co-testing can identify women at high risk of cervical cancer or cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 (CIN3) or worse over 5 years.We assessed the 5-year cumulative incidence, starting in 2003-05, of cervical cancer and CIN3 or worse for 331,818 women aged 30 years and older who enrolled in co-testing at Kaiser Permanente Northern California (Berkeley, CA, USA) and had adequate enrolment co-test results. Follow-up continued until Dec 31, 2009. We defined cumulative incidence to include prevalence at enrolment and incidence after enrolment. Prevalence at enrolment was defined as the ratio of women diagnosed with each outcome on the biopsy visit immediately after their enrolment screening visit to the total enrolled women. At screening visits only HPV test and Pap smear samples were collected, and at biopsy visits colposcopically directed biopsies were taken. To estimate post-enrolment incidence, we used Weibull survival models.In 315,061 women negative by HPV testing, the 5-year cumulative incidence of cancer was 3.8 per 100,000 women per year, slightly higher than for the 306,969 who were both negative by HPV and Pap testing (3.2 per 100,000), and half the cancer risk of the 319,177 who were negative by Pap testing (7.5 per 100,000). 313,465 (99.5%) women negative by HPV testing had either normal cytology or equivocal abnormalities. Abnormal cytology greatly increased cumulative incidence of CIN3 or worse over 5 years for the 16,757 positive by HPV testing (12.1%vs 5.9%; p<0.0001). By contrast, although statistically significant, abnormal cytology did not increase 5-year risk of CIN3 or worse for women negative by HPV testing to a substantial level (0.86%vs 0.16%; p=0.004). 12,208 (73%) of the women positive by HPV testing had no cytological abnormality, and these women had 258 (35%) of 747 CIN3 or adenocarcinoma in situ, [corrected] 25 (29%) of 87 cancers, and 17 (63%) of 27 adenocarcinomas.For women aged 30 years and older in routine clinical practice who are negative by co-testing (both HPV and cytology), 3-year screening intervals were safe because a single negative test for HPV was sufficient to reassure against cervical cancer over 5 years. Incorporating HPV testing with cytology also resulted in earlier identification of women at high risk of cervical cancer, especially adenocarcinoma. Testing for HPV without adjunctive cytology might be sufficiently sensitive for primary screening for cervical cancer.Intramural Research Program of the US National Cancer Institute/NIH/DHHS, and the American Cancer Society.Efficacy of HPV DNA testing with cytology triage and/or repeat HPV DNA testing in primary cervical cancer screening.Primary cervical screening with both human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA testing and cytological examination of cervical cells with a Pap test (cytology) has been evaluated in randomized clinical trials. Because the vast majority of women with positive cytology are also HPV DNA positive, screening strategies that use HPV DNA testing as the primary screening test may be more effective.We used the database from the intervention arm (n = 6,257 women) of a population-based randomized trial of double screening with cytology and HPV DNA testing to evaluate the efficacy of 11 possible cervical screening strategies that are based on HPV DNA testing alone, cytology alone, and HPV DNA testing combined with cytology among women aged 32-38 years. The main outcome measures were sensitivity for detection of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 or worse (CIN3+) within 6 months of enrollment or at colposcopy for women with a persistent type-specific HPV infection and the number of screening tests and positive predictive value (PPV) for each screening strategy. All statistical tests were two-sided.Compared with screening by cytology alone, double testing with cytology and for type-specific HPV persistence resulted in a 35% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 15% to 60%) increase in sensitivity to detect CIN3+, without a statistically significant reduction in the PPV (relative PPV = 0.76, 95% CI = 0.52 to 1.10), but with more than twice as many screening tests needed. Several strategies that incorporated screening for high-risk HPV subtypes were explored, but they resulted in reduced PPV compared with cytology. Compared with cytology, primary screening with HPV DNA testing followed by cytological triage and repeat HPV DNA testing of HPV DNA-positive women with normal cytology increased the CIN3+ sensitivity by 30% (95% CI = 9% to 54%), maintained a high PPV (relative PPV = 0.87, 95% CI = 0.60 to 1.26), and resulted in a mere 12% increase in the number of screening tests (from 6,257 to 7,019 tests).Primary HPV DNA-based screening with cytology triage and repeat HPV DNA testing of cytology-negative women appears to be the most feasible cervical screening strategy.Human papillomavirus (HPV) detection using in situ hybridization in histologic samples: correlations with cytologic changes and polymerase chain reaction HPV detection.Although in situ hybridization (ISH) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) have extensively been used on cytology specimens, there have been limited reports of the usefulness of these techniques in relation to confirmed histologic findings. In this study, we used PCR and ISH to detect human papillomavirus (HPV) in cytologic and histologic specimens, respectively. By using positive and negative likelihood ratios, we attempted to identify any predictive role of ISH testing alone or in combination with PCR for the development of high-grade histologic lesions (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia [CIN] 2+). In our study, ISH was a useful method for detection of HPV, even in a large fraction of samples with normal cytologic or biopsy findings. We suggest that when used together and evaluated in conjunction with histologic sections, ISH is a useful tool for ancillary molecular testing of HPV infection in cervical lesions, especially in CIN 2+ histological lesions where its analytic sensitivities and specificities were as good as those of PCR testing.Concurrent evaluation of visual, cytological and HPV testing as screening methods for the early detection of cervical neoplasia in Mumbai, India.Naked eye visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA), magnified VIA (VIAM), visual inspection with Lugol's iodine (VILI), cytology and human papillomavirus (HPV) testing were evaluated as screening methods for the detection of high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL) of the uterine cervix in a cross-sectional study in Mumbai, India.Cytology, HPV testing, VIA, VIAM and VILI were carried out concurrently for 4039 women aged 30-65 years. All women were investigated with colposcopy and biopsies were taken from 939 women who had colposcopic abnormalities. The reference standard for final disease status was histology or negative colposcopy. The presence of HSIL was confirmed in 57 women (1.4%). The test characteristics for each method were calculated using standard formulae.The sensitivities of cytology, HPV testing, VIA, VIAM and VILI were 57.4%, 62.0%, 59.7%, 64.9%, and 75.4%, respectively (differences were not statistically significant). The specificities were 98.6%, 93.5%, 88.4%, 86.3%, and 84.3%, respectively. Adding a visual test to cytology or HPV testing in parallel combination resulted in a substantial increase in sensitivity, with a moderate decrease in specificity. The parallel combination of VILI and HPV testing resulted in a sensitivity of 92.0% and a specificity of 79.9%.As a single test, cytology had the best balance of sensitivity and specificity. Visual tests are promising in low-resource settings, such as India. The use of both VIA and VILI may be considered where good quality cytology or HPV testing are not feasible. The sensitivity of cytology and HPV testing increased significantly when combined with VIA or VILI.SNIPER: a novel assay for human papillomavirus testing among women in Guizhou, China.Clinically validate the SNIPER human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA assay for the detection of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN)2 or higher and CIN2 or higher in a prospective cross-sectional screening study in Guizhou Province, China.Between March and April, 2008, 1000 nonpregnant women aged 30 or older were recruited in Guizhou Province, China. Women positive by SNIPER or cytological examination were requested to return for follow-up. A biopsy of all colposcopically detected abnormalities was performed by quadrant. In normal quadrants, biopsies were obtained at the squamocolumnar junction (2-, 4-, 8-, and 10-o'clock positions depending on the quadrant). Samples were placed in 2 mL of saline solution and maintained between 2 degrees C and 30 degrees C for up to 1 week. One milliliter of this suspension was then prepared and tested. For polymerase chain reaction amplification, a pool of HPV primers was designed to amplify HPV DNA from 13 high-risk-HPV genotypes (types 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, and 68). Test characteristics were calculated according to standard definitions.One thousand women were screened; 175 tested HPV positive, 36 women tested negative but had positive Papanicolaou test results. All but 21 (90%) returned for follow-up. Median age and proportions having CIN2 or higher and CIN3 or higher differed by HPV status. Twenty-five women had CIN2 or higher and 16 had CIN3 or higher. The SNIPER assay was 93.3% and 94% sensitive and 86% and 85% specific for the detection of CIN2 or higher and CIN3 or higher, respectively. The positive predictive value was 17.4 % and 9.9% for CIN2 or higher and CIN3 or higher, respectively. Negative predictive value approached 100% for CIN2 or higher and CIN3 or higher.The SNIPER assay is functionally competitive and in terms of cost holds an advantage over Hybrid Capture 2 in a Chinese healthcare market, and potentially others, around the world.Evaluation of human papillomavirus testing in primary screening for cervical abnormalities: comparison of sensitivity, specificity, and frequency of referral.Human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA testing of women having Papanicolaou (Pap) smears showing atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS) has clinical usefulness. Whether HPV DNA testing alone is useful in primary screening remains to be determined.To determine the accuracy of HPV DNA testing for detecting cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) grade 3 or cancer (the criterion standard).Between December 1997 and October 2000, 4075 women who attended Planned Parenthood clinics in Washington State were screened simultaneously using thin-layer Pap and HPV DNA testing by a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based method and by a liquid-based RNA-DNA hybridization capture with signal amplification assay (signal amplification). Women who were positive for high-risk HPV types, or had Pap results of ASCUS or higher, were considered to have positive screening test results and were referred for colposcopy and biopsy. Additionally, a random sample of women with negative screening test results was referred for colposcopy. Based on individual and combined thin-layer Pap, HPV PCR, and HPV signal amplification test results from the screening and the colposcopy visits, 7 colposcopy triage strategies were defined and evaluated.Sensitivity and specificity for detecting cervical lesions graded CIN 3 or higher for each of the 7 triage strategies.The estimated prevalence of CIN 3 or higher was 3.2%. The sensitivity (95% confidence interval) of thin-layer Pap (with a result of > or = ASCUS) for identifying women with CIN 3 or higher was only 61.3% (48.5%-70.9%) compared with 88.2% (78.9%-93.8%) for HPV testing by PCR and 90.8% (83.1%-95.8%) by signal amplification. Differences in specificities were also observed: 82.4% (81.8%-83.1%) for thin-layer Pap (with a result of > or = ASCUS), 78.8% (77.9%-79.7%) for PCR, and 72.6% (69.4%-75.0%) for signal amplification. Compared with referral for colposcopy of all women with ASCUS or higher, signal amplification testing of women with ASCUS and referral of those with a positive result was about as sensitive (61.3% vs 60.3%, respectively) and significantly more specific (82.4% vs 88.9%, respectively). The strategy requiring repeat positive PCR tests on 2 visits had a sensitivity of 84.2% (75.3%-91.0%) and a specificity of 86.2% (85.1%-87.3%). All tests were more specific and less sensitive in older (> or = 30 years) vs younger women.Testing for HPV has higher sensitivity but lower specificity than thin-layer Pap screening. In some settings, particularly where screening intervals are long or haphazard, screening for HPV DNA may be a reasonable alternative to cytology-based screening of reproductive-age women.Comparison of single-, double- and triple-combined testing, including Pap test, HPV DNA test and cervicography, as screening methods for the detection of uterine cervical cancer.Cervical cancer is a serious disease that threatens the health of women worldwide. This study compared the sensitivities and false-positive rates of cervical cytology (Pap smear), human papilloma virus (HPV) DNA test, cervicography, first double-combined testing (cervical cytology and HPV DNA test), second double-combined testing (cervical cytology and cervicography) and triple-combined testing (cervical cytology, HPV DNA test and cervicography). The study included 261 patients screened for uterine cervical cancer. All women simultaneously underwent cervical cytology, HPV DNA test and cervicography for uterine cervical cancer screening and colposcopically directed biopsy for diagnostic evaluation. The triple-combined testing was consistently the most sensitive among the cervical screening tests. The second double-combined testing, with a sensitivity rate of 98.1% was more sensitive than the first double-combined test (92.3%). However, cervical cytology was most specific (93.5%) and showed the highest positive predictive value (77.8%). The sensitivity of cervical cytology was markedly improved in combination with HPV DNA test and cervicography. Thus, the triple-combined testing, which improves the high false negativity of cervical cytology, may be an effective tool in uterine cervical cancer screening, pending confirmation of the effectiveness in a mass screening study.Adjunctive testing for cervical cancer in low resource settings with visual inspection, HPV, and the Pap smear.To test whether the performance of visual inspection using acetic acid (VIA) could be improved through adjunctive testing and to determine whether the combination of visual inspection of the cervix and HPV testing could prove useful for identifying those at highest risk of cervical precancer.Between October 1995 and August 1997, 2199 women willing to be screened for cervical cancer in peri-urban clinics in Harare, Zimbabwe received VIA, Pap smear and HPV as screening tests. The presence or absence of (pre)cancer was confirmed via colposcopy with biopsy as indicated for >97% of all women. Computerized simulations of sequential testing scenarios provided estimates of the joint (net) test qualities of different paired combinations of the three tests and allowed for comparisons with the individual test qualities.Using HGSIL/CIN II-III as the reference threshold of disease, the net sensitivity and specificity of VIA and HPV when used sequentially were 63.6 and 81.9%, respectively, compared to 43.3 and 91%, respectively, when Pap smears were followed by HPV testing. VIA followed by the Pap smear yielded a net sensitivity of 37.5% and net specificity of 94.3%.For programs with limited resources but with the capacity for HPV testing, sequential testing involving the use of VIA followed by HPV could yield fewer false positives than the use of VIA alone at a cost of relatively few additional false negatives.Primary screening for cervical cancer based on high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) detection and HPV 16 and HPV 18 genotyping, in comparison to cytology.The objective of the present study is to assess the performance of a high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) DNA test with individual HPV-16/HPV-18 genotyping as a method for primary cervical cancer screening compared with liquid-based cytology (LBC) in a population of Greek women taking part in routine cervical cancer screening.The study, conducted by the "HEllenic Real life Multicentric cErvical Screening" (HERMES) study group, involved the recruitment of 4,009 women, aged 25-55, who took part in routine cervical screening at nine Gynecology Departments in Greece. At first visit cervical specimens were collected for LBC and HPV testing using the Roche Cobas 4800 system. Women found positive for either cytology or HPV were referred for colposcopy, whereas women negative for both tests will be retested after three years. The study is ongoing and the results of the first screening round are reported herein.Valid results for cytology and HPV testing were obtained for 3,993 women. The overall prevalence of HR-HPV was 12.7%, of HPV-16 2.7% and of HPV-18 1.4%. Of those referred for colposcopy, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or worse (CIN2+) was detected in 41 women (1.07%). At the threshold of CIN2+, cytology [atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US) or worse] and HPV testing showed a sensitivity of 53.7% and 100% respectively, without change between age groups. Cytology and HPV testing showed specificity of 96.8% and 90.3% respectively, which was increased in older women (≥30) in comparison to younger ones (25-29). Genotyping for HPV16/18 had similar accuracy to cytology for the detection of CIN2+ (sensitivity: 58.5%; specificity 97.5%) as well as for triage to colposcopy (sensitivity: 58.5% vs 53.7% for cytology).HPV testing has much better sensitivity than cytology to identify high-grade cervical lesions with slightly lower specificity. HPV testing with individual HPV-16/HPV-18 genotyping could represent a more accurate methodology for primary cervical cancer screening in comparison to liquid-based cytology, especially in older women.Complementary procedures in cervical cancer screening in low resource settings.To evaluate the efficacy of pap smear, HPV DNA testing and colposcopy and to determine the approach for cervical cancer screening in low resource settings.Eight hundred non pregnant married women above 30 years of age were studied and subjected to pap smear examination. Hysterectomised women were excluded from the study. Selected patients were followed by HPV DNA testing by Hybrid Capture II method, colposcopy and biopsy. Sensitivity, specificity, Positive predictive value (PPV), Negative predictive value (NPV), diagnostic accuracy and kappa value (k) were calculated for each screening test.Out of eight hundred women with mean age 36.5 ± 5.94 years undergoing pap smear, ASCUS was found in 66(8.25%), ASC-H in 2(0.25%), LSIL in 48(6%), HSIL in 8(1%), inflammatory in 540(67.5%). Out of 260 women who underwent HPV DNA testing, 120 (46.15%) had abnormal cytology and/or positive HPV DNA test (Group I, n = 120) and 140(53.8%) had dual negative results (Group II, n = 140) HPV DNA test was found positive in 64 women (53.3%) in Group I. Sensitivity and specificity of pap smear was 69.2 and 63.72% while for HPV DNA testing was 92.3 and 84% respectively. PPV and NPV of pap smear, HPV DNA testing and colposcopy was 18, 40, 76.4% and 94.7, 98.9, 100% respectively. Diagnostic accuracy of pap smear (k = 0.14), HPV DNA test (k = 0.70) and colposcopy (k = 0.81) was 64.29, 84.9, and 96.8% respectively. Combining pap smear & HPV DNA testing (k = 0.25) increased the sensitivity and NPV to 100%.Sensitivity and diagnostic accuracy of HPV DNA test is more than that of pap smear and the test is not influenced by inflammatory conditions of vagina. In low resource settings, women with ASCUS and LSIL on cervical cytology should be subjected to HPV DNA test and only if found positive should be referred for colposcopy thereby reducing colposcopy referrals. Women with HSIL should be directly subjected to colposcopy guided biopsy. Using this approach, most of the preinvasive cervical lesion will be detected but few cases will still be missed among inflammatory smears, if HPV DNA testing is not supplemented.Different cervical cancer screening approaches in a Chinese multicentre study.To evaluate alternative cervical cancer screening methods, digital colposcopy and collection of cervical exfoliated cells for liquid-based cytology (LBC) and hybrid capture 2 (HC2) testing were performed among 2562 women aged 15-59 years in three study sites in the People's Republic of China (rural Shanxi province, Shenyang city in Liaoning province and Shenzhen city in Guangdong province). Visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA) was also evaluated independently from colposcopy. A total of 74 cases of histologically confirmed cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or worse (CIN2+) were identified, and 16 CIN2+ cases were imputed among unbiopsied women to correct for verification bias. Corrected sensitivity for CIN2+ was 37% for VIA, 54% for colposcopy, 87% for LBC with a threshold of atypical cells of undetermined significance (LBC>or=ASCUS), 90% for HC2, 84% for LBC using HC2 to triage ASCUS and 96% for positivity to LBC>or=ASCUS or HC2. For VIA, sensitivity was much lower among women >or=40 years (12%) than those aged <or=39 years (50%). Specificity varied from 77% for positivity to LBC>or=ASCUS or HC2, up to 94% for LBC using HC2 to triage ASCUS. In conclusion, LBC, HC2 and their combinations performed well, whereas VIA missed a majority of CIN2+, particularly in older women. Digital colposcopy performed better than VIA, but still missed nearly half of CIN2+ in this study.Human papillomavirus testing for primary screening of cervical cancer precursors.Our objective was to determine whether the addition of human papillomavirus (HPV) testing to screening cytology improves the detection of cervical cancer precursors. Women of ages 18-69 years underwent conventional Pap cytology and HPV DNA testing in a multicenter study in Newfoundland, Canada. Those with positive cytology and/or HPV and a random sample of those with dual negative results were referred for colposcopy. The study enrolled 2098 women. The relative sensitivity of HPV testing was significantly higher than cytology for all-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions [SILs; 73%; 95% confidence interval (CI), 62-82] and high grade SILs (HSILs; 90%; 95% CI, 74-97) but had lower relative specificity (62% for all-grade SILs and 51% for HSILs) than most cytological cutpoints. The rate of combined correct results for all-grade lesions was higher for HPV testing (68.8%) than for any cytological cutpoint (equivocal, 52.3%; LSILs, 51.6%; HSILs, 44.5%). The combination of HPV and an LSIL cutpoint had a negative predictive value of 68% (95% CI, 52-80) for all SILs and 100% (95% CI, 91-100) for HSILs, while referring for colposcopy only 12% of the women. We concluded that HPV testing in conjunction with cytology improved the screening efficacy of cytology alone and may allow for a more effective and safe primary screening program with increased screening intervals.Genital human papillomavirus infection among women recruited for routine cervical cancer screening or for colposcopy determined by Hybrid Capture II and polymerase chain reaction.The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical use of the Hybrid Capture (HC)-II system for the detection of human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA to identify women at risk of progression to high grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HGSIL) and carcinomas by differentiating low risk (LR) HPV types (6, 11, 42, 43, 44) and high/intermediate risk (HR) HPV types (16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, 68). Five hundred and ninety-six women were enrolled in the study. Among them, 466 attended the hospital for routine cytologic screening and 130 were referred for colposcopy because of an abnormal Pap smear. The presence of HPV DNA was tested in cervical samples collected with the Digene Cervical Sampler in Digene Specimen Transport Medium (Digene Corporation, Silver Spring, MD, U.S.A.) using the HC-II assay. Results were compared with those obtained by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the MY09-MY11 primers followed by several hybridizations with specific probes. The overall HPV positivity was 32.9% by HC-II and 37.8% by PCR. Among cytologically normal smears, 19.5% were positive by HC-II (14.3% HR) and 25.1% by PCR. Of the atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance samples, 52.9% were positive by HC-II (41.1% HR) and 55.9% by PCR. Of the low grade SIL, 64.5% were positive by HC-II (59.4% HR) and 68.7% by PCR. The HPV positivity rate was found identical by both techniques in high grade smears (81.6%) and squamous cervical carcinomas (100%). By using PCR as the reference method, the sensitivity of HC-II was higher among women with abnormal cytology than with normal cytology (87.3% vs. 70%). Specificity was 80.8% and 97.5%, respectively. In summary, these results indicate that the HC-II method and MY-PCR identified nearly equivalent prevalences of HPV in cervical smear specimens.Combined Pap smear, cervicography and HPV DNA testing in the detection of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and cancer.The sensitivity of the Pap smear (PAP) continues to be the subject of debate. During the past several years, cervicography (CER) and HPV DNA testing have been suggested as optional tools in the screening of cervical cancer precursors.The performance characteristics of PAP, CER and HPV DNA testing (hybrid capture test [HCT]) in all potential combinations were evaluated in a series of 1,030 women (aged 16-70, median, 33), subjected to colposcopy (COLPO) as the reference tool.Of the 992 evaluable cases, 402/992 (41%) had positive COLPO (i.e., an abnormal transformation zone). Of them, 298 women underwent directed punch biopsy, while of the COLPO negative patients, 18/93 positive by at least one of the three tests had endocervical curettage. Of the 402 COLPO positive women, 146 (36%) remained negative on all tests, whereas 256 (64%) had at least one positive test. There were 84 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 2 and 3 lesions and 6 invasive carcinomas. Of the former, 10 were detected by PAP alone, 4 by CER alone and 3 by HCT alone. Three of the 6 carcinomas were HCT negative. The predictive value (PPV) of a positive test was 45% for PAP, 51% for CER and 48% for HCT. The combinations of PAP with CER (for PAP negative cases) and PAP with HCT were more sensitive for CIN 2 and 3 (95% and 94%, respectively) as compared with PAP alone but were associated with a significant decrease in specificity (44% and 46% vs. 57%, respectively). However, both combinations retained a PPV (43%) similar to that of PAP alone (45%).The potential combinations of PAP with CER and with HCT were more sensitive in detecting CIN 2 and 3 as compared with PAP alone and retained a PPV similar to that of PAP.A comparison of single and combined visual, cytologic, and virologic tests as screening strategies in a region at high risk of cervical cancer.Increased understanding of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection as the central cause of cervical cancer has permitted the development of improved screening techniques. To evaluate their usefulness, we evaluated the performance of multiple screening methods concurrently in a large population-based cohort of >8500 nonvirginal women without hysterectomies, whom we followed prospectively in a high-risk region of Latin America. Using Youden's index as a measure of the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity, we estimated the performances of a visual screening method (cervicography), conventional cytology, liquid-based cytology (ThinPrep), and DNA testing for 13 oncogenic HPV types. The reference standard of disease was neoplasia > or = cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 (CIN 3), defined as histologically confirmed CIN 3 detected within 2 years of enrollment (n=90) or invasive cancer detected within 7 years (n=20). We analyzed each technique alone and in paired combinations (n=112 possible strategies), and evaluated the significance of differences between strategies using a paired Z test that equally weighted sensitivity and specificity. As a single test, either liquid-based cytology or HPV DNA testing was significantly more accurate than conventional cytology or cervicography. Paired tests incorporating either liquid-based cytology or HPV DNA testing were not substantially more accurate than either of those two test strategies alone. However, a possibly useful synergy was observed between the conventional smear and cervicography. Consideration of age or behavioral risk profiles did not alter any of these conclusions. Overall, we conclude that highly accurate screening for cervical cancer and CIN 3 is now technically feasible. The remaining vital issue is to extend improved cervical cancer prevention programs to resource-poor regions.Evaluation of alternative methods of cervical cancer screening for resource-poor settings.Noncytologic methods of screening for cervical carcinoma and its precursor lesions are needed for resource-poor settings in which cervical carcinoma continues to be an important cause of morbidity and mortality.Two thousand nine hundred forty-four women ages 35-65 years were recruited from Cape Town, South Africa and screened using a combination of a Papanicolaou (Pap) smear, human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA testing, direct visual inspection after the application of a 5% acetic acid solution (DVI), and cervicography. Cervicography was considered primarily as a method with which to quality control the DVI examinations. Women with squamous intraepithelial lesions (SIL) or carcinoma on Pap smear, positive DVI examination (acetowhite lesion or cervical ulcer/growth), high levels of high risk HPV DNA (relative light units [RLU] > 10x positive control), or positive Cervigramtrade mark were referred for colposcopy and cervical biopsy.Pap smears were positive in 8.1% of all women screened and identified 65 (78%) of all cases of biopsy confirmed high grade disease (high grade SIL or invasive carcinoma). DVI and cervicography were classified as positive in 18.1% and 10.5%, respectively, of women screened and identified 58 (67%) and 46 (58%) of all cases of high grade disease, respectively. The results of HPV DNA testing varied depending on the cutoff value used to define a positive result. At the standard cutoff level (RLU > 1x positive control), 16.2% of women screened were classified as high risk HPV DNA positive, as were 63 women with high grade disease (73%).DVI and HPV DNA testing identified similar numbers of high grade SIL (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia Grade 2,3) and invasive carcinoma cases as Pap smears. However, both classify considerably more women without cervical disease as being test positive.Evaluation of a cervical cancer screening program based on HPV testing and LLETZ excision in a low resource setting.We conducted studies in Vanuatu to evaluate potential screening and treatment strategies to assist with control of cervical cancer. In a pilot study of 496 women, visual inspection and cytology were evaluated as screening tests for detection of CIN 2 or worse (CIN2+), observed in 21 of 206 subjects biopsied on the basis of abnormal visual inspection or cytology. Sensitivity of visual inspection with Lugol's Iodine for detection of CIN2+ on biopsy was 0.63, specificity was 0.32, and the positive predictive value was 0.09. For HSIL cytology, sensitivity was 0.99, specificity was 0.77, and the positive predictive value was 0.88. HSIL cytology was significantly more sensitive and had a significantly higher PPV for CIN 2+ than visual inspection (p<0.01). In a further study of 514 women, we compared testing for HR HPV and cytology as predictors of biopsy proven CIN 2+. Sensitivity of HSIL cytology for CIN2+ as established by loop excision of the cervix was 0.81, specificity was 0.94, and positive predictive value was 0.48. Sensitivity of a positive test for HR HPV for detection of CIN2+ was non-significantly different from cytology at 0.81, specificity was 0.94, and positive predictive value was 0.42. Combining the two tests gave a significantly lower sensitivity of 0.63, a specificity of 0.98, and a positive predictive value of 0.68. For women over 30 in a low resource setting without access to cytology, a single locally conducted test for high risk HPV with effective intervention could reduce cervical cancer risk as effectively as intervention based on cytology conducted in an accredited laboratory.Clinical prediction based on HPV DNA testing by hybrid capture 2 (HC2) in combination with liquid-based cytology (LBC).Primary screening by HPV DNA testing is an effective method for reducing cervical cancer and has proven more sensitive than cytology. To advance this approach, many molecular methods have been developed. Hybrid capture 2 provides semi-quantitative results in ratios of relative light units and positive cutoff values (RLU/ PC). Twenty-five thousand and five patients were included in this study to analyze the correlation between the ratio of RLU/PC and stage of cervical dysplasia. The results show that the RLU/PC ratios ranged from 0-3500 while almost normal cases, ASC-US and ASC-H, had values below 200. Of those samples negative for cytology markers, 94.6% were normal and their RLU/PC ratios were less than 4. With an RLU/PC ratio greater than 4 and less than or equal to 300, the percentages in all age groups were normal 53.6%, LSIL 20.2%, ASC-US 17.2%, HSIL 6.13%, ASC-H 2.72%, and AGC 0.11%, respectively. In contrast, 64.0% of samples with a RLU/ PC ratio greater than 300 and less than or equal to 3500 were LSIL. These results should contribute to cost effective cervical cancer management strategies. Further studies of associations with particular HPV genotypes would be useful to predict the risk of progression to cancer.A comparison of HPV DNA testing and liquid based cytology over three rounds of primary cervical screening: extended follow up in the ARTISTIC trial.The additional sensitivity of HPV testing compared with cytology could permit extended cervical screening intervals. We wished to determine, through a further (third) round of screening in the ARTISTIC trial, the protection provided by a negative baseline HPV screen compared with that of cytology over a 6 year period.Cumulative rates of CIN2 or worse (CIN2+) and CIN3 or worse (CIN3+) were correlated with baseline HPV status and cytology. HPV was detected using the Hybrid Capture 2 (Qiagen) assay for high risk types and genotyped using the Linear Array (Roche) and Papillocheck (Greiner) assays. LBC was performed using ThinPrep (Hologic).Round 3 included 8,873 women of whom 6,337 had been screened in both rounds 1 and 2 and 2,536 had not been screened since round 1. The median duration of follow-up was 72.7 months. The cumulative rate of CIN2+ over three rounds was 3.88% (95%CI 3.59%, 4.17%) overall; 2.39% in round 1, 0.78% in round 2 and 0.74% in round 3. Cumulative rates by baseline status were 20.53% (95%CI 19.04%, 22.08%) for abnormal cytology, 20.12% (95%CI 18.68%, 21.61%) for HPV detection, 1.41% (95%CI 1.19%, 1.65%) for negative cytology and 0.87% (95%CI 0.70%, 1.06%) for a negative HPV test. In HPV negative women aged over 50 the cumulative rate was 0.16% (95%CI 0.07%, 0.34%). Women who were HPV positive/cytology negative at entry had a cumulative CIN2+ rate of 7.73% (95%CI 6.29%, 9.36%) over 6 years, twice the overall rate.A negative HPV test was significantly more protective than normal cytology over three rounds. The findings of this extension of ARTISTIC suggest that the screening interval could be extended to 6 years if HPV testing replaced cytology as the primary screening test.A population-based clinical trial comparing endocervical high-risk HPV testing using hybrid capture 2 and Cervista from the SHENCCAST II Study.Our objective was to directly compare the accuracy of the high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) assays, Hybrid Capture 2 (hc2; Qiagen, Gaithersburg, MD) and Cervista (Hologic, Bedford, MA), in diagnosing cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 3 or worse (cancer). A population-based, cross-sectional study (The Shenzhen Cervical Cancer Screening Trial II) was conducted in Guangdong Province in China. Three high-risk HPV assays, self and direct cervical sampling and cytology, were studied. Abnormal results on any of 6 study tests (33%) resulted in referral to colposcopy. At colposcopy, every patient had at least 5 cervical biopsy specimens obtained. For 8,556 women between the ages of 25 and 59 years (mean, 38.9 years), the rate for CIN 3 or worse was 1.6% (141/8,556). The sensitivity (confidence interval) values for CIN 3 or worse were 97.9% (94.0%-99.6%) and 95.1% (90.0%-98.0%) for hc2 and Cervista, respectively (P > .05). The specificity (confidence interval) values were 87.8% (87.1%-88.5%) and 90.3% (89.6%-90.9%), respectively (P < .05). Differences in accuracy in diagnosing CIN 3 or worse with the hc2 and Cervista tests are minor and result from the decisions made in selecting the cut points.Factors associated with colposcopy-histopathology confirmed cervical intraepithelial neoplasia among HIV-infected women from Rio De Janeiro, Brazil.Despite the availability of preventive strategies (screening tests and vaccines), cervical cancer continues to impose a significant health burden in low- and medium-resourced countries. HIV-infected women are at increased risk for infection with human papillomavirus (HPV) and thus development of cervical squamous intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN).Study participants included HIV-infected women enrolling the prospective open cohort of Evandro Chagas Clinical Research Institute, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (IPEC/FIOCRUZ). At cohort entry, women were subjected to conventional Papanicolaou test, HPV-DNA test and colposcopy; lesions suspicious for CIN were biopsied. Histopathology report was based on directed biopsy or on specimens obtained by excision of the transformation zone or cervical conization. Poisson regression modeling was used to assess factors associated with CIN2+ diagnosis.The median age of the 366 HIV-infected women included in the study was 34 years (interquartile range: 28-41 years). The prevalence of CIN1, CIN2 and CIN3 were 20.0%, 3.5%, and 2.2%, respectively. One woman was found to have cervical cancer. The prevalence of CIN2+ was 6.0%. Factors associated with CIN2+ diagnosis in the multivariate model were age < years compared to ≥ 35 years (aPR = 3.22 95%CI 1.23-8.39), current tobacco use (aPR = 3.69 95%CI 1.54-8.78), nadir CD4 T-cell count <350 cells/mm3 when compared to ≥ 350 cells/mm3 (aPR = 6.03 95%CI 1.50-24.3) and concomitant diagnosis of vulvar and/or vaginal intraepithelial lesion (aPR = 2.68 95%CI 0.99-7.24).Increased survival through wide-spread use of highly active antiretroviral therapy might allow for the development of cervical cancer. In Brazil, limited cytology screening and gynecological care adds further complexity to the HIV-HPV co-infection problem. Integrated HIV care and cervical cancer prevention programs are needed for the prevention of cervical cancer mortality in this group of women.Efficiency of the hybrid capture 2 HPV DNA test in cervical cancer screening. A study by the French Society of Clinical Cytology.The aim of this study was to determine the efficiency of the Hybrid Capture 2 (HC2; Digene, Gaithersburg, MD) human papillomavirus (HPV) assay for the detection of cervical neoplasia. Of the 1,785 patients recruited, 462 (25.88%) were referred for colposcopy owing to previously detected cytologic abnormalities, and 1,323 (74.12%) were voluntary candidates for screening. For all patients, a Papanicolaou smear and a monolayer smear (ThinPrep, Cytyc, Boxborough, MA) were done. HPV DNA was detected on the residual liquid-based material. False-positive results were observed in 111 cases and comprised 34 cross-reactions (1.90%) and 77 false-positive cases (4.31%) owing to a contiguous strong chemiluminescence signal. Interestingly, all these samples had a relative light units value of 1 to 3 and were contiguous to a sample with a very high HPV DNA load. The final results showed that high-risk and low-risk HPV DNA were detected in 480 samples (26.89%) and 135 samples (7.56%), respectively. Although HC2 can be considered a reliable and sensitive test for HPV DNA detection, we do not advocate its use for large-scale screening for cervical neoplasia.Detection of human telomerase RNA gene in cervical cancer and precancerous lesions: comparison with cytological and human papillomavirus DNA test findings.The aims of this study were to compare the findings of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) detection of human telomerase RNA gene (hTERC) amplification with that of cytological and human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA tests and explore the possibility to improve the accuracy of the diagnoses of high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and cervical cancer.A total of 201 specimens of liquid-based thin-layer cytological examination findings were collected and detected by HPV DNA test and hTERC detected by FISH. All women underwent colposcopy and histological examination of biopsy specimen if needed. The 3 screening methods were compared based on histological examination of colposcopic biopsies.The amplification of hTERC showed 6.06% in normal or inflammation cases, 10.00% in CIN 1, 66.67% in CIN 2, 72.50% in CIN 3, and 100.00% in carcinoma, with significant difference between the low- (<or=CIN 1 or <or=low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion) and high-grade (>or=CIN 2 or >or=atypical squamous cells in which high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion cannot be excluded) cervical lesions (P < 0.001). The hTERC amplification rate was consistent with abnormal rates of cytological and histological diagnoses. The detection of hTERC amplification had a much higher accuracy (87.56%) than the cytological (80.10%) and HPV DNA test (77.61%) findings.Using FISH to detect the amplification of hTERC had a much higher specificity and accuracy for the diagnoses of high-grade CIN and cervical cancer than cytological and HPV DNA test findings, suggesting that this detection might be a useful and specific screening method in cervical cancer and precancerous lesions.Human papillomavirus testing and conventional pap smear cytology as optional screening tools of women at different risks for cervical cancer in the countries of the former soviet union.Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is a sexually transmitted disease (STD) and the single most important etiological agent of cervical cancer. In parallel with the increase of STDs and because of the lack of any organized cancer screening in the new independent states of the former Soviet Union, the incidence and mortality rates of cervical cancer are rapidly rising. This is the first report from an ongoing European Commission-funded (INCO-Copernicus Program) cross-sectional and cohort study (focused on the key issues of this major health problem in the new independent states) analyzing the performance of the HPV DNA (Hybrid Capture II) test as a potential screening tool for cervical cancer in these countries.A series of 3,175 women (screening, gynecological, or STD patients) from six clinics in Russia, Belarus, and Latvia received routine cytology and HPV testing with Hybrid Capture II (HCII). All women with HPV-positive results or abnormalities in cytology were subjected to colposcopy and biopsy. The sensitivity, specificity, receiver operating characteristics, as well as positive (PPV) and negative predicting values (NPV), were determined for HCII and quality-controlled cytology in detecting significant pathology (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia [CIN] 3 and cancer).Significant pathology was strongly associated with high-grade cytology (odds ratio [OR] = 8.5; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 4.1-17.8; chi-square, p < .0001). Pap smear cytology detected high-grade lesions with a sensitivity of 64.0% (44.8-83.2), specificity of 89.1% (84.5-93.7), PPV of 44.4% (28.8-61.0), and NPV of 94.8% (91.2-98.4). Of the 3,086 samples analyzed by HCII, 33.0% were positive for oncogenic HPV types, with a wide variation (from 23% to 45%) between the three patient groups (p < .0001). The presence of high-grade cytology was significantly associated with HCII positivity at all cutoff levels (OR = 14.4; 95% CI = 8.4-24.5; chi-square, p < .0001; 1 pg/mL threshold). In the receiver operating characteristics curve, the HCII cutoff point most closely balancing sensitivity (83.1%) and specificity (75.6%) was 2 pg/mL. The presence of high-grade histology was associated with HCII positivity (cutoff 1 pg/mL; OR = 4.8; 95% CI = 0.7-34.2;p = .047). At the cutoff (1 pg/mL), sensitivity of the HCII test was 96.6% (90.0-100), specificity was 15.9% (10.6-21.2), PPV was 15.1% (9.9-20.3), and NPV was 96.8% (90.3-100). Changing the cutoff significantly affected sensitivity at 20 pg/mL and NPV at 500 pg/mL.HCII assay is a sensitive tool in detecting significant pathology, but less specific than the Pap test. A negative HCII test practically precludes high-grade CIN (NPV, >95%). Because the performance characteristics of the HCII test depend on the prevalence of HPV and CIN in the study population, the cost-benefit issues in different settings will be the limiting factor for the application of this test as a screening tool.Expanded cytological referral criteria for colposcopy in cervical screening: comparison with human papillomavirus testing.The goal of this study was to investigate whether expanded cytologic referral criteria for colposcopy or the addition of human papillomavirus (HPV) testing on cervical screening could improve the rates of detection of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN).HPV testing by semiquantitative polymerase chain reaction/ELISA was performed in 1000 women who were self-referred for routine Pap smear. They underwent colposcopy following an abnormal smear result or a positive HPV test. As abnormal smear results were considered reports of low- or high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion, atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance, and even HPV-associated reactive cellular changes (mild koilocytosis, mild dyskeratocytosis, hyperchromatic nuclei, bimultinucleation, and cleared cytoplasm). Loop excision of the transformation zone was performed in women with cytology and colposcopy indicative of CIN, as well as in women with normal cytology but positive HPV test and colposcopic impression of CIN.The Pap test was abnormal in 89% of the cases of CIN 1 (34/38) and 96% of CIN 2/3 (27/28) diagnosed in our population. HPV testing picked up four additional cases of CIN 1 (11%) and one case of CIN 2/3 (4%). Overall the HPV test detected 95% of the cases of CIN 1 (36/38) and 89% of the cases of CIN 2/3 (25/28).HPV testing does not appear to add significantly to cytology in terms of positive predictive value or detection rate, if extended cytologic indications for colposcopy are used.The probability for a Pap test to be abnormal is directly proportional to HPV viral load: results from a Swiss study comparing HPV testing and liquid-based cytology to detect cervical cancer precursors in 13,842 women.In a study involving 13,842 women and 113 gynaecologists, liquid-based cytology and HPV testing for detecting cervical cancer were compared. A total of 1334 women were found to be positive for one or both tests and were invited for colposcopy with biopsy. A total of 1031 satisfactory biopsies on 1031 women were thereafter collected using a systematic biopsy protocol, which was random in the colposcopically normal-appearing cervix or directed in the abnormal one. In all, 502 women with negative tests were also biopsied. A total of 82 histologic high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) were reported in biopsies, all from the group with one or both tests positive. Sensitivity and specificity to detect histologic HSIL were 59 and 97% for cytology, and 97 and 92% for HPV. In total, 14% of reviewed negative cytological preparations associated with histologic HSIL contained no morphologically abnormal cells despite a positive HPV test. This suggested a theoretical limit for cytology sensitivity. HPV viral load analysis of the 1143 HPV-positive samples showed a direct relationship between abnormal Pap test frequency and HPV viral load. Thus, not only does the HPV testing have a greater sensitivity than cytology but the probability of the latter being positive can also be defined as a function of the associated HPV viral load.The performance of human papillomavirus high-risk DNA testing in the screening and diagnostic settings.We sought to evaluate the performance of the human papillomavirus high-risk DNA test in patients 30 years and older.Screening (n=835) and diagnosis (n=518) groups were defined based on prior Papanicolaou smear results as part of a clinical trial for cervical cancer detection. We compared the Hybrid Capture II (HCII) test result with the worst histologic report. We used cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 2/3 or worse as the reference of disease. We calculated sensitivities, specificities, positive and negative likelihood ratios (LR+ and LR-), receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, and areas under the ROC curves for the HCII test. We also considered alternative strategies, including Papanicolaou smear, a combination of Papanicolaou smear and the HCII test, a sequence of Papanicolaou smear followed by the HCII test, and a sequence of the HCII test followed by Papanicolaou smear.For the screening group, the sensitivity was 0.69 and the specificity was 0.93; the area under the ROC curve was 0.81. The LR+ and LR- were 10.24 and 0.34, respectively. For the diagnosis group, the sensitivity was 0.88 and the specificity was 0.78; the area under the ROC curve was 0.83. The LR+ and LR- were 4.06 and 0.14, respectively. Sequential testing showed little or no improvement over the combination testing.The HCII test in the screening group had a greater LR+ for the detection of CIN 2/3 or worse. HCII testing may be an additional screening tool for cervical cancer in women 30 years and older.Primary cervical cancer screening and triage using an mRNA human papillomavirus assay and visual inspection.Mexican Cervical Cancer Screening Study II (MECCS II) seeks to develop a highly sensitive and highly specific screening program able to be adapted to all socioeconomic levels in Mexico. The objectives of MECCS II are (1) to compare the sensitivity and specificity for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 3 or cancer of self-collected vaginal specimens tested for high-risk types of the human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) by APTIMA with those tested for HR-HPV by Hybrid Capture 2 (HC2); and (2) determine the efficacy of cryotherapy in the treatment of HR-HPV-positive and acetic acid-aided visual inspection (VIA)-positive and -negative women after VIA triage.The study was conducted in rural Mexico. Women aged 30 to 50 years, nonpregnant, with no history of hysterectomy or pelvic irradiation and varied histories of screening, participated. A direct endocervical sample was tested for cytology, HC2, and APTIMA assay (AHPV). Subjects positive on any test were recalled for triage VIA, biopsies, and immediate cryotherapy. Tests were compared using McNemar test.Two thousand forty-nine patients have complete results. Mean age of the patients was 39.2 years; 7.7% presented with ≥atypical squamous cells of uncertain significance (ASCUS), 1.8% ≥low-grade squamous intraepithelial neoplasia, and 0.5% ≥high-grade squamous intraepithelial neoplasia. Two percent of patients had ≥CIN2, and 0.78% had ≥CIN3 (including 2 with invasive disease). The sensitivity of ThinPrep (>ASCUS), HC2, and AHPV for >CIN3 for direct endocervical collection was 87.5%, 100%, and 100%, respectively. The specificity of ThinPrep (>ASCUS), HC2, and AHPV for >CIN3 was 94.1%, 92.2%, and 93.5%, respectively. Specificities of HC2 and AHPV differed significantly. The overall percentage of agreement among HPV assays (HC2 vs APTIMA) is 97%. Four hundred sixty-nine women returned for VIA. Two hundred ninety-one women were treated with cryotherapy.The specificity of the APTIMA assay along with high sensitivity is an advantage for primary screening. Follow-up evaluation will be important to determine the true impact of potential undertreatment in the screening algorithm. Self-sampling applications are explored.Prevalence of type-specific human papillomavirus in endocervical, upper and lower vaginal, perineal and vaginal self-collected specimens: Implications for vaginal self-collection.To determine why a vaginal self-collection tested for high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) by Hybrid Capture 2(R) (hc2) has lower sensitivity and specificity for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia Grade 2 or worse (> or = CIN 2), we collected 5 specimens (endocervix, upper and lower vagina, perineum, vaginal self-collection) from 2,625 women. Endocervical and self-collected specimens had HR-HPV tests by hc2. All 5 anogenital specimens were tested for 37 HPV genotypes [Linear Array(R), (LA)] from 397 women hc2 positive in endocervical or self-collected specimens and for a randomly selected 71 of 2,228 women hc2 negative on both specimens. Three hundred nintey-five women who screened positive by hc2 or had abnormal cytology underwent colposcopic evaluation. Of 47 women with > or = CIN 2, hc2 was positive in 97.9% (46/47) of endocervical and 80.9% (38/47), p = 0.008 of self-collected specimens. Seven of 9 women with > or = CIN 2 and negative self-collected hc2 tests were positive for HR-HPV by LA. Of 2,578 women without > or = CIN 2, hc2 was positive in 9.8% (253/2,578) of endocervical and 11.4% (294/2,578), p = 0.001 of self-collected specimens. Of the 41 more women without > or = CIN 2 that tested hc2 positive on the self-collected but negative on endocervical specimen, LA tested positive for HR-HPV in 24, negative for HPV in 11 and negative for HR-HPV but positive for low-risk HPV in 6. Lower sensitivity of self-collected specimens is secondary to lower levels of vaginal HR-HPV. The principal cause of the lower specificity of self-collected specimens is HR-HPV present solely in the vagina, which is not associated with > or = CIN 2.Effectiveness of VIA, Pap, and HPV DNA testing in a cervical cancer screening program in a peri-urban community in Andhra Pradesh, India.While many studies have compared the efficacy of Pap cytology, visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA) and human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA assays for the detection cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and cancer, few have evaluated the program effectiveness.A population-based sample of 5603 women from Medchal Mandal in Andhra Pradesh, India were invited to participate in a study comparing Pap cytology, VIA, and HPV DNA screening for the detection of CIN3+. Participation in primary screening and all subsequent follow-up visits was rigorously tracked. A 20% random sample of all women screened, in addition to all women with a positive screening test result underwent colposcopy with directed biopsy for final diagnosis. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values were adjusted for verification bias. HPV testing had a higher sensitivity (100%) and specificity (90.6%) compared to Pap cytology (sensitivity = 78.2%; specificity = 86.0%) and VIA (sensitivity = 31.6%; specificity = 87.5%). Since 58% of the sample refused involvement and another 28% refused colposcopy or biopsy, we estimated that potentially 87.6% of the total underlying cases of CIN3 and cancer may have been missed due to program failures.We conclude that despite our use of available resources, infrastructure, and guidelines for cervical cancer screening implementation in resource limited areas, community participation and non-compliance remain the major obstacles to successful reduction in cervical cancer mortality in this Indian population. HPV DNA testing was both more sensitive and specific than Pap cytology and VIA. The use of a less invasive and more user-friendly primary screening strategy (such as self-collected swabs for HPV DNA testing) may be required to achieve the coverage necessary for effective reduction in cervical cancer mortality.HPV DNA testing in population-based cervical screening (VUSA-Screen study): results and implications.Human papillomavirus (HPV) testing is more sensitive than cytology for detecting high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). We evaluated the performance of high-risk HPV (hrHPV) testing in routine screening.In all, 25,871 women (29-61) enrolled in our population-based cohort study were offered both cytology and hrHPV testing. High-risk HPV-positive women with normal cytology and an age-matched subcohort of hrHPV-negative women with normal cytology were invited for repeat testing after 1 and/or 2 years and were referred for colposcopy if they presented with abnormal cytology and/or a positive hrHPV test. The hrHPV-positive women with borderline or mild dyskaryosis (BMD) and all women with moderate dyskaryosis or worse (>BMD) were directly referred for colposcopy. Women with BMD and an hrHPV-negative test were advised to repeat cytology at 6 and 18 months and were referred for colposcopy if the repeat cytology test was abnormal. The main outcome measure was CIN grade 3 or worse (CIN3+). Results were adjusted for non-attendance at repeat testing.The hrHPV-positive women with abnormal cytology had a CIN3+ risk of 42.2% (95% confidence interval (CI): 36.4-48.2), whereas the hrHPV-positive women with normal cytology had a much lower risk of 5.22% (95% CI: 3.72-7.91). In hrHPV-positive women with normal cytology, an additional cytology step after 1 year reduced the CIN3+ risk to only 1.6% (95% CI: 0.6-4.9) if the repeat test was normal. The CIN3+ risk in women with hrHPV-positive normal cytology was higher among women invited for the first time (29-33 years of age) (9.1%; 95% CI: 5.6-14.3) than among older women (3.0%; 95% CI: 1.5-5.5).Primary hrHPV screening with cytology triage in women aged 30 years is an effective way to stratify women on CIN3+ risk and seems a feasible alternative to cytological screening. Repeat cytology after 1 year for hrHPV-positive women with normal cytology is however necessary before returning women to routine screening.Cross sectional study of conventional cervical smear, monolayer cytology, and human papillomavirus DNA testing for cervical cancer screening.To compare the sensitivity, specificity, and interobserver reliability of conventional cervical smear tests, monolayer cytology, and human papillomavirus testing for screening for cervical cancer.Cross sectional study in which the three techniques were performed simultaneously with a reference standard (colposcopy and histology).Public university and private practices in France, with complete independence from the suppliers.828 women referred for colposcopy because of previously detected cytological abnormalities and 1757 women attending for routine smears.Clinical readings and optimised interpretation (two blind readings followed, if necessary, by consensus). Sensitivity, specificity, and weighted kappa computed for various thresholds of abnormalities.Conventional cervical smear tests were more often satisfactory (91% v 87%) according to the Bethesda system, more reliable (weighted kappa 0.70 v 0.57), and had consistently better sensitivity and specificity than monolayer cytology. These findings applied to clinical readings and optimised interpretations, low and high grade lesions, and populations with low and high incidence of abnormalities. Human papillomavirus testing associated with monolayer cytology, whether systematic or for atypical cells of undetermined significance, performed no better than conventional smear tests.Monolayer cytology is less reliable and more likely to give false positive and false negative results than conventional cervical smear tests for screening for cervical cancer.Population-based cervical cancer screening using high-risk HPV DNA test and liquid-based cytology in northern Thailand.Northern Thailand is a region with a high cervical cancer incidence. Combined high-risk HPV (hrHPV) DNA testing and cytology (co-testing) has increasingly gained acceptance for cervical cancer screening. However, to our knowledge, data from a population-based screening using co-testing have not been available in this region. This study therefore aimed to evaluate the performance of cytology and hrHPV test in women in northern Thailand.Cervical samples were collected for hybrid capture 2 (HC2) testing and liquid-based cytology from women aged 30 to 60 years who were residents in 3 prefectures of Chiang Mai in northern Thailand between May and September 2011. Women with positive cytology were referred to colposcopy, while women with positive for HC2 only were followed for 2 years.Of 2,752 women included in this study, 3.0% were positive in both tests, 4.1% for HC2 only, and 1.3% had positive cytology only. At baseline screening, positive HC2 was observed in 70.6% among cytology-positive women compared with 4.3% among cytology-negative women. The prevalence of positive HC2 or cytology peaked in the age group 35-39 years and was lowest in the age group 55-60 years. High-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion or worse lesions (HSIL+) were histologically detected in 23.5% of women with positive baseline cytology and in 9.8% of women with positive baseline HC2 only on follow-up. All women with histologic HSIL+ had positive baseline HC2.The hrHPV test is superior to cytology in the early detection of high-grade cervical epithelial lesions. In this study, the prevalence of histologic HSIL+ on follow-up of women with positive hrHPV test was rather high, and these women should be kept under careful surveillance. In northern Thailand, hrHPV testing has a potential to be used as a primary screening test for cervical cancer with cytology applied as a triage test.A cluster randomized controlled trial of visual, cytology and human papillomavirus screening for cancer of the cervix in rural India.The impact of screening by visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA), cytology or HPV testing on cervical cancer incidence and mortality is investigated in a cluster randomized controlled trial in India. We report findings after the screening phase, when 52 clusters, with a total of 142,701 women aged 30-59 years in Osmanabad District, India, were randomized into 4 arms for a single round of screening by trained midwives with either VIA, cytology or HPV testing as well as a control group. All laboratory tests were done locally. Test-positive women underwent investigations (colposcopy/biopsy) and treatment in the base hospital. Data on participation, test positivity, positive predictive value and detection rates of cervical neoplasia were analyzed using cluster design methodology. Of the eligible women, 72-74% were screened. Test positivity rates were 14.0% for VIA, 7.0% for cytology and 10.3% for HPV. The detection rate of high-grade lesions was similar in all intervention arms (0.7% for VIA, 1.0% for cytology and 0.9% for HPV testing) (p = 0.06, Mann-Whitney test). While the detection rate for VIA dropped to 0.5% with declining test positivity during the course of the study, it remained constant for cytology and HPV testing. Over 85% of women with high-grade lesions received treatment. Our results show that a high level of participation and good-quality cytology can be achieved in low-resource settings. VIA is a useful alternative but requires careful monitoring. Detection rates obtained by HPV testing were similar to cytology, despite higher investments.Shanxi Province Cervical Cancer Screening Study: a cross-sectional comparative trial of multiple techniques to detect cervical neoplasia.The aim of this study was to design a cervical cancer screening algorithm for the developing world that is highly sensitive for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) II, III, and cancer and highly specific for CIN II and III, making it possible to ablate the transformation zone without histologic confirmation.In rural Shanxi Province, China, we examined 1997 women ages 35-45. Each subject underwent a self-test for intermediate and high-risk HPV (by HC-II assay), fluorescence spectroscopy, a liquid-based Pap (read manually and by computer and used as a direct test for HPV), a visual inspection (VIA) diagnosis, and colposcopy with multiple cervical biopsies.Mean age was 39.1 +/- 3.16 years, mean number of births was 2.6 +/- 0.93. Based on tests administered, 4.3% subjects had > or =CIN II. All subjects with > or =CIN II had either a ThinPrep Pap (> or =ASCUS) or a positive HPV direct test. The sensitivity and specificity for the detection of > or =CIN II were, respectively, 83 and 86% for the HPV self-test, 95 and 85% for the HPV direct test, 94 and 78% for the ThinPrep Pap (> or =ASCUS), 77 and 98% for the ThinPrep Pap (> or =HGSIL), 94 and 9% for fluorescence spectroscopy, 71 and 74% for VIA, and 81 and 77% for colposcopy.Based on these data and the existing healthcare infrastructure in China, we believe that further refinement of primary HPV screening using centralized labs is indicated. Self-testing in the local villages may be effective with improvements in the devices and techniques.Hybrid capture II for high-risk human papillomavirus DNA testing to detect cervical precancerous lesions: A qualitative and quantitative study.Hybrid capture II (HC-II) is the only technique that can be used in clinical human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA detection. However, there is controversy in regards to how to analyze and assess the viral load of high-risk (HR)-HPV by use of HC-II and the relation between viral load and cervical lesions. In this study, we analyzed the results of a sequential screening of outpatients at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology of the China-Japan Friendship Hospital, and we aimed to explore the relationship between HR-HPV viral load and the severity of cervical lesions, and to clarify the clinical significance of the titer of HR-HPV DNA determined by HC-II. Using HC-II, 2,761 women were screened for HR-HPV DNA combined with cytological testing using liquid-based cytology. All women with HR-HPV-positive results or abnormalities in cytology underwent a cervical biopsy through colposcopy. Cervical biopsies were taken in 1,051 women. The HR-HPV infection rate was 78.35% (76/97) in HPV-associated lesions, 87.33% (193/221) in cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) I, 94.74% (144/152) in CIN II, 100% (178/178) in CIN III and 100% (20/20) in invasive cervical cancer (ICC), respectively (P<0.05). Based on the criteria of histopathology, the sensitivity of HR-HPV DNA testing by HC-II for detecting high-grade cervical lesions was 97.71%, the specificity was 79.64%, the positive-predictive value was 41.06% and the negative-predictive value was 99.59%. The viral loads of HR-HPV DNA were 512.15±764.19 in HPV-associated lesions, 753.95±978.27 in CIN I, 871.08±1003.52 in CIN II, 603.40±740.25 in CIN III and 466.44±673.05 in ICC, respectively. In conclusion, the positive rate of HR-HPV increased significantly in accordance with the severity of cervical lesions. The viral loads of cervical inflammatory lesions were markedly lower than CINs and ICC. The viral loads of HR-HPV DNA tested by HC-II had no correlation with the grade of cervical lesions.Clinical validation of a type-specific real-time quantitative human papillomavirus PCR against the performance of hybrid capture 2 for the purpose of cervical cancer screening.To be acceptable for use in cervical cancer screening, a new assay that detects DNA of high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) types must demonstrate high reproducibility and performance not inferior to that of a clinically validated HPV test. In the present study, a real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay targeting the E6 and E7 genes of hrHPV was compared with Hybrid Capture 2 (hc2) in a Belgian cervical cancer screening setting. In women >30 years old, the sensitivity and specificity for intraepithelial neoplasias of grade 2 or worse (93 cases of cervical intraepithelial neoplasias of grade 2 or worse (CIN2+) and 1,207 cases of no CIN or CIN1) were 93.6% and 95.6%, respectively, and those of hc2 were 83.9% and 94.5%, respectively {relative sensitivity of qPCR/hc2 = 1.12 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.01 to 1.23]; relative specificity = 1.01 [95% CI, 0.99 to 1.03]}. A score test showed that the sensitivity (P < 0.0001) and specificity (P < 0.0001) of the qPCR assay were not inferior to those of hc2 at the required thresholds of 90% and 98%, respectively. The overall agreement of hrHPV positivity between the two runs of the qPCR tests was 98.7% (95% CI, 97.5 to 99.4%), with a kappa value of 0.96 (95% CI, 0.83 to 1.00). The qPCR assay used in this study can be considered a reliable HPV assay that fulfills the clinical validation criteria defined for use in cervical cancer screening.Comparison of HPV test versus conventional and automation-assisted Pap screening as potential screening tools for preventing cervical cancer.To evaluate new techniques in primary cervical cancer screening programmes.Cross sectional pilot study.Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Helsinki University Hospital.Consecutive 2032 human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA and Pap smear samples were taken. Histological diagnoses were obtained from 460 patients.We compared the validity of the high risk (HR) HPV DNA detection test to automation-assisted and conventional Pap smear screening.Specificity and sensitivity of screening methods.Twenty-three percent of women were HPV positive. Forty-five of 46 had high grade lesions and cancers were HR HPV DNA positive, whereas 72/93 of low grade and more severe lesions were HR HPV DNA positive. When histologically verified high grade lesions were observed, the relative sensitivity of HR Hybrid Capture 2 (HR HC2) test was 98% compared with conventional Pap smear and Papnet tests, which performed 54%versus 58%, 83%versus 86% and 93%versus 98% relative sensitivity respectively, using cytological diagnoses HSIL (high grade squamous intraepithelial lesion), LSIL (low grade squamous intraepithelial lesion) or ASCUS (atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance) as the cutoff. The specificity of HC2 test (77-79%) was comparable with the ASCUS+ (ASCUS and more severe) cytology (68-79%), but lower when compared with LSIL+ (91-95%) or especially HSIL+ (97-99%) Pap smear results.Pap smear, as a screening test, is very different from HPV DNA detecting test HR HC 2. If cutoff LSIL or more severe lesions is used, primary Pap smear is clearly more specific than HR HC2, but markedly less sensitive. Due to high relative sensitivity of the HPV, only very few histologically confirmed high grade lesions would be detected among HPV negatives using simultaneous cytology. On the other hand, using HPV DNA test alone would lead to multifold amounts of referrals for colposcopy. A posterior Pap smear assessment among HPV positives might be helpful in increasing sensitivity and specificity of screening and defining those who need an immediate referral or treatment. We plan to incorporate primary HR HPV DNA test with posterior Pap smear reading of HPV positives into our ongoing randomised prospective multiarm trial evaluating new techniques in organised screening for cervical cancer in Finland.Evaluation of oncogenic human papillomavirus RNA and DNA tests with liquid-based cytology in primary cervical cancer screening: the FASE study.The APTIMA HPV Assay (AHPV) allows detection of 14 high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) RNA types in cervical specimens. Until present, the assay has been compared to HPV DNA tests only in triage settings. Herein, we compare AHPV with a DNA assay (Hybrid Capture 2; HC2) and liquid-based cytology (LBC; using PreservCyt ThinPrep liquid Pap) in a screening setting (French APTIMA screening evaluation [FASE] study). Women (N = 5,006) aged 20-65 were screened by gynecologists in 17 private practices in Paris, France. One cervical specimen was collected and tested with LBC, AHPV and HC2 assays. Women were referred to colposcopy if they were ASC-US+ in LBC or HPV positive in either HPV assay. To control for verification bias, a random group (14%) with normal LBC and dually HPV negative tests underwent colposcopy. Data from 4,429 women were analyzed. Sensitivity, specificity and predictive values were calculated for the three tests. AHPV and HC2 were highly sensitive for CIN2+ (92.0% and 96.7%) and CIN3+ (95.7% and 95.3%) detection and much more sensitive than LBC (69.1% for CIN2+ and 73.3% for CIN3+). Specificity of AHPV was higher than that of HC2, but similar to that of LBC (p < 0.001). Combining LBC with either HPV test slightly increased sensitivity but compromised specificity. AHPV assay is both specific and sensitive for the detection of high-grade precancerous lesions and may be considered as an option for routine cervical cancer screening for women over 20 years of age.Performance characteristics of Pap test, VIA, VILI, HR-HPV testing, cervicography, and colposcopy in diagnosis of significant cervical pathology.We sought to evaluate the performance of diagnostic tools to establish an affordable setting for early detection of cervical cancer in developing countries. We compared the performance of different screening tests and their feasibility in a cohort of over 12,000 women: conventional Pap smear, liquid-based cytology, visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA), visual inspection with Iodine solution (VILI), cervicography, screening colposcopy, and high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) testing (HR-HPV) collected by physician and by self-sampling. HR-HPV assay collected by the physician has the highest sensitivity (80 %), but high unnecessary referrals to colposcopy (15.1 %). HR-HPV test in self-sampling had a markedly lower (57.1 %) sensitivity. VIA, VILI, and cervicography had a poor sensitivity (47.4, 55, and 28.6 %, respectively). Colposcopy presented with sensitivity of 100 % in detecting CIN2+, but the lowest specificity (66.9 %). Co-testing with VIA and VILI Pap test increased the sensitivity of stand-alone Pap test from 71.6 to 87.1 % and 71.6 to 95 %, respectively, but with high number of unnecessary colposcopies. Co-testing with HR-HPV importantly increased the sensitivity of Pap test (to 86 %), but with high number of unnecessary colposcopies (17.5 %). Molecular tests adjunct to Pap test seems a realistic option to improve the detection of high-grade lesions in population-based screening programs.BD-ProExC as adjunct molecular marker for improved detection of CIN2+ after HPV primary screening.We investigated the efficacy of 8 cervical cancer screening strategies relative to cytology with emphasis on immunocytochemical detection of high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV)-induced cell transformation (BD-ProExC) as a tool of triage following primary cytology or hrHPV testing. 3,126 women were tested with BD-SurePath liquid-based cytology, hrHPV PCR genotyping and BD-ProExC immunostaining, and colposcopy verification to calculate sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV) in detecting cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN2(+)).Compared to cytology screening, double testing with cytology and hrHPV resulted in the same sensitivity with a significant increase in the PPV (relative PPV: 1.83). However, twice as many tests were needed. Cytology with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US) triage and hrHPV testing showed comparative results to double testing requiring only a small increase in number of tests. Screening for hrHPV subtypes 16/18, and ASC-US triage with hrHPV16/18 resulted in significant reductions in sensitivity (ratio: 0.74 and 0.96, respectively). Primary hrHPV/BD-ProExC screening was significantly more sensitive (ratio: 1.63/1.33), but had a significantly lower PPV (ratio: 0.64/0.88). ASC-US triage by BD-ProExC increased the PPV (ratio: 1.90) but decreased the sensitivity (ratio: 0.96). Primary hrHPV screening followed by BD-ProExC triage, led to significant increases in sensitivity (ratio: 1.30) and PPV (ratio: 2.89), and resulted in 55% fewer referrals for colposcopy.From the investigated screening strategies, primary hrHPV DNA-based screening followed by BD-ProExC triage was determined to be the best screening strategy.Immunocytological triage could be used to perfect hrHPV primary screening.Evaluation of a human papillomavirus assay in cervical screening in Zimbabwe.To determine the utility of an assay for high risk genital human papillomavirus (HPV) in cervical screening in Zimbabwe, Africa.Cross-sectional study.Harare, Zimbabwe.Zimbabwe women (n = 2,140), 25 to 55 years old, recruited in clinics in Chitungwiza and Greater Harare.Genital specimens were assessed for HPV, using the HPV DNA test Hybrid Capture II (probe B). Further assessment of the women was conducted using colposcopy and biopsy as indicated. High grade squamous intraepithelial lesions were diagnosed in 215 women. Colposcopy and/or biopsy showed low grade lesions in 346 women.The overall prevalences were: 42 x 7% for HPV, 10% for high grade squamous intraepithelial lesions and 16% for low grade lesions. Prevalence for HPV decreased significantly with increase in age (P for trend < 0 x 0001) and increased significantly with increasing disease severity, from 35% in normal women, to 53% in women with low grade lesions and 81% in women with high grade lesions (P for trend < 0 x 001). In specimens positive for HPV, the amount was 14-fold higher in women with high grade lesions compared with normal women. In screening for high grade lesions the assay for HPV had a sensitivity of 81% (CI 75%-86%); sensitivity for low grade lesions was 64% (CI 60%-68%). Specificity was 62% (CI 59%-64%) for high grade lesions and 65% (CI 62%-67%) for low grade lesions. The positive predictive value was 19% (CI 17%-22%) for high grade lesions and 39% (CI 36%-42%) for low grade lesions.For high grade squamous intraepithelial lesions the sensitivity of the Hybrid Capture II HPV DNA test was high, but the specificity was relatively low. The test may therefore be most useful in conjunction with other screening tests.Human papillomavirus testing in primary cervical screening.Several studies have examined the role of tests for human papillomavirus (HPV) in screening for cervical cancer but as yet the relevance is unclear. We looked at HPV testing for types 16, 18, 31, and 33 on material taken at the time of a cervical smear in 2009 eligible women having routine screening. Women with any degree of dyskaryosis or high levels of one of these HPV types were referred for colposcopy. 44% of the cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) lesions of grade 2/3 detected had negative cytology and were found only by HPV testing. A further 22% of the CIN 2/3 lesions were positive for HPV but showed only borderline or mild cytological changes. The positive predictive value of HPV testing was 42%, which was similar to that for moderate dyskaryosis. HPV types 16 and 31 were more sensitive and specific for CIN 2/3 than were types 18 or 33. However, 25% of the CIN 2/3 lesions were not detected by these four HPV tests. We suggest that HPV testing could usefully augment but not replace conventional cytology. These results should stimulate a much larger randomised trial to assess the impact of these improved CIN 2/3 detection rates on the subsequent incidence of invasive cancer.Incidence and outcome of acquisition of human papillomavirus infection in women with normal cytology--a population-based cohort study from Taiwan.Little is known about acquisition of human papillomavirus (HPV) and its outcome among older women with negative HPV testing and normal cytology. A longitudinal 3-yr follow-up of nested-cohort subjects (n = 8825) from a population-based cervical cancer screening study whose Pap and HPV tests were negative at baseline were conducted. Every active HPV-negative (n = 413) participant had 12-mo follow-ups of Pap smear and HPV testing. Colposcopy was performed if either HPV-positive or cytology was abnormal. The cytology and histology information of the remaining subjects (passive HPV-negative, n = 8412) was obtained from national registry database. Median age of participants was 45 yr (range, 30-73 yr). The incidence of new acquisition was 4.2/100 woman-years. The 3-yr cumulative total HPV acquisition rate was 11.1% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 8.1-14.1). Increased number of sexual partners (> or =2 vs. 1) of the participant was associated with risk of acquisition (odds ratio [OR]: 5.0, 95% CI: 2.0-12.6) by multivariate analysis. Three cases of > or = cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 2 were identified in 3-yr follow-up in active HPV-negative subjects. HPV genotypes in the dysplastic tissue were actually present at baseline samples after reanalysis. From the passive HPV-negative group, only 1 case progressed to CIN2 probably after HPV acquisition. Negative Pap and HPV tests assured a very low risk of developing > or = CIN2 within 3 yr despite incident HPV infection.A new HPV-DNA test for cervical-cancer screening in developing regions: a cross-sectional study of clinical accuracy in rural China.A new test (careHPV; QIAGEN, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) has been developed to detect 14 high-risk types of carcinogenic human papillomavirus (HPV) in about 2.5 h, to screen women in developing regions for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). We did a cross-sectional study to assess the clinical accuracy of careHPV as a rapid screening test in two county hospitals in rural China.From May 10 to June 15, 2007, the careHPV test was done locally by use of self-obtained vaginal and provider-obtained cervical specimens from a screening population-based set of 2530 women aged 30 to 54 years in Shanxi province, China. All women were assessed by visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA), Digene High-Risk HPV HC2 DNA Test (HC2), liquid-based cytology, and colposcopy with directed biopsy and endocervical curettage as necessary. In 2388 women with complete data, 441 women with negative colposcopy, but unsatisfactory or abnormal cytology or who were positive on HC2 or the new careHPV test, were recalled for a second colposcopy, four-quadrant cervical biopsies, and endocervical curettage. An absence of independence between the tests was not adjusted for and the Bonferroni correction was used for multiple comparisons.Complete data were available for 2388 (94.4%) women. 70 women had CIN2+ (moderate or severe CIN or cancer), of whom 23 had CIN3+. By use of CIN2+ as the reference standard and area-under-the-curve analysis with a two-sided alpha error level of 0.0083, the sensitivities and specificities of the careHPV test for a cut-off ratio cut-point of 0.5 relative light units, were 90.0% (95% CI 83.0-97.0) and 84.2% (82.7-85.7), respectively, on cervical specimens, and 81.4% (72.3-90.5) and 82.4% (80.8-83.9), respectively, on vaginal specimens (areas under the curve not significantly different, p=0.0596), compared with 41.4% (29.9-53.0) and 94.5% (93.6-95.4) for VIA (areas under the curve significantly different, p=0.0001 and p=0.0031, for cervical and vaginal-specimen comparisons for the careHPV test, respectively). The sensitivity and specificity of HC2 for cervical specimens were 97.1% (93.2-100) and 85.6% (84.2-87.1), respectively (areas under the curve not significantly different from the careHPV test on cervical specimens, p=0.0163).The careHPV test is promising as a primary screening method for cervical-cancer prevention in low-resource regions.Baseline cytology, human papillomavirus testing, and risk for cervical neoplasia: a 10-year cohort analysis.Annual Pap smear screening has been favored over less frequent screening in the United States to minimize the risk of cervical cancer. We evaluated whether simultaneous screening with a Pap test and human papillomavirus (HPV) testing is useful for assessing the risk for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 3 or cervical cancer.We enrolled 23 702 subjects in a study of HPV infection at Kaiser Permanente, Northwest Division, Portland, OR. Data were analyzed for 20 810 volunteers who were at least 16 years old (mean = 35.9 years) with satisfactory baseline Pap tests and suitable samples for HPV testing. Women were followed for up to 122 months (from April 1, 1989, to June 30, 1999) to determine the risk for histopathologically confirmed CIN3 or cancer.Among 171 women with CIN3 or cancer diagnosed over 122 months, 123 (71.9%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 65.2% to 78.7%) had baseline Pap results of atypical squamous cells or worse and/or a positive HPV test, including 102 (86.4%, 95% CI = 80.3% to 92.6%) of the 118 cases diagnosed within the first 45 months of follow-up. During this 45-month period, the cumulative incidence of CIN3 or cancer was 4.54% (95% CI = 3.61% to 5.46%) among women with a Pap test result of atypical squamous cells or worse, positive HPV tests, or both compared with 0.16% (95% CI = 0.08% to 0.24%) among women with negative Pap and HPV tests. Age, screening behavior, a history of cervical cancer precursors, and a history of treatment for CIN minimally affected results.Negative baseline Pap and HPV tests were associated with a low risk for CIN3 or cancer in the subsequent 45 months, largely because a negative HPV test was associated with a decreased risk of cervical neoplasia. Negative combined test results should provide added reassurance for lengthening the screening interval among low-risk women, whereas positive results identify a relatively small subgroup that requires more frequent surveillance.Liquid based cytology and HPV DNA testing in a Greek population compared to colposcopy and histology.Screening for cervical cancer in Greece is still unorganised and based on self- motivation. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of cytological findings from a large observational population sample, originating from Western Athens, in association with reflex DNA test, colposcopic estimation, and final histologic diagnosis. The rate of invasive carcinoma, both squamous cell and adenocarcinoma, is indicative of a largely unscreened population. In this study, the estimated overall prevalence of human papilloma virus (HPV) was 41.1%, with HPV positivity at 37.4% of cytologically normal women. HPV testing did not seem to improve sensitivity of cytology for atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US) and low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LGSIL) cases in identifying CIN 2+ lesions, but outperformed cytology in detecting CIN3+ for cytological high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HGSIL) cases. For HGSIL cases sensitivity of colposcopy for detecting CIN3+ was comparable to cytology.Diagnostic accuracy of self-collected human papillomavirus specimens as a primary screen for cervical cancer.The aim of the study was to compare the sensitivity of self-collected with clinician-collected human papillomavirus (HPV) tests and cytology for cervical cancer. A total of 250 non-pregnant, 25-60-year-old women from Leon, Nicaragua, self-collected vaginal specimens for HPV and received a pelvic examination for cytology and reflex HPV. All participants underwent colposcopy and completed questionnaires regarding demographic and medical information. The sensitivities of self-collected brushes, self-collected swabs and clinician-collected HPV tests were 25%, 16.7%, and 16.7%, respectively, with colposcopy as the gold standard and 30%, 22.2% and 40% when cytology was the gold standard. Agreement between self-collection methods was significant (κ=0.84, p<0.001). Although utilisation of colposcopy in every participant resulted in lower sensitivities, the self-collected tests surpassed cytology and significantly agreed with the clinician-collected results. Further clarification of the sensitivity will be required to employ self-collection for cervical cancer screening in low resource areas like rural Nicaragua.Improved sensitivity of vaginal self-collection and high-risk human papillomavirus testing.Self-collected vaginal specimens tested for high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) have been shown to be less sensitive for the detection of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia or cancer (≥CIN 3) than physician-collected endocervical specimens. To increase the sensitivity of self-collected specimens, we studied a self-sampling device designed to obtain a larger specimen from the upper vagina (POI/NIH self-sampler) and a more sensitive polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based HR-HPV assay. Women (10,000) were screened with cervical cytology and HR-HPV testing of vaginal self-collected and endocervical physician-collected specimens. Women were randomly assigned to use either a novel self-collection device (POI/NIH self-sampler) or conical-shaped brush (Qiagen). The self-collected and clinician-collected specimens were assayed by Cervista (Hologic) and the research only PCR-based matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF). Women with any abnormal screening test underwent colposcopy and biopsy. Women (8,556), mean age of 38.9, had complete data; 1.6% had ≥ CIN 3. For either HR-HPV assay, the sensitivity was similar for the two self-collection devices. Tested with Cervista, the sensitivity for ≥CIN 3 of self-collected specimens was 70.9% and for endocervical specimens was 95.0% (p = 0.0001). Tested with MALDI-TOF, the sensitivity for ≥CIN 3 of self-collected specimens was 94.3% and for endocervical specimens was also 94.3% (p = 1.0). A self-collected sample using a PCR-based assay with the capability of very high throughput has similar sensitivity as a direct endocervical specimen obtained by a physician. Large population-based screening "events" in low-resource settings could be achieved by promoting self-collection and centralized high-throughput, low-cost testing by PCR-based MALDI-TOF.Long-term follow-up of cervical disease in women screened by cytology and HPV testing: results from the HART study.Several studies have shown that testing for high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) types results in an improved sensitivity for CIN2+, compared with cytology, although with a somewhat lower specificity.We obtained follow-up results, with at least one smear after participation in the HART study, which compared HPV testing (HC-II) with cytology as a primary screening modality.With a median follow-up of 6 years, 42 additional cases of CIN2+ were identified; women who were HPV positive at baseline were more likely to develop CIN2+ than those who were HPV negative (hazard ratio (HR) 17.2; 95% confidence interval (CI) (9.3-31.6)) and the risk increased with increasing viral load. Compared with HPV-negative women (relative light unit (RLU) <1), the HR (95% CI) was 5.4 (1.6, 18.2) for 1-10 RLU and 25.5 (13.6, 47.9) for RLU > or = 10. Positive cytology (borderline or worse compared with negative) was also predictive of developing CIN2, although to a lesser extent (HR 8.7; 95% CI (4.5-17.1)). Only one case of CIN3 and three cases of CIN2 were found in women who showed a positive cytology result but were HPV negative at baseline.After 5 years of follow-up, CIN2+ occurred in 0.23% of women who were HPV negative at baseline compared with 0.48% of women who showed a negative cytology result, indicating a much longer low-risk interval for CIN2+ after HPV testing.A comprehensive evaluation of the accuracy of cervical pre-cancer detection methods in a high-risk area in East Congo.Given the high burden of cervical cancer in low-income settings, there is a need for a convenient and affordable method for detecting and treating pre-cancerous lesions.Samples for comparing the accuracy of cytology, virology and histology were collected. Identification of HPV E6/E7 mRNA was performed using PreTect HPV-Proofer. HPV DNA detection was performed by GP5+/6+ PCR, followed by reverse line blot (RLB) for typing.A total of 343 women, aged 25-60 years, attending gynaecological polyclinics in DR Congo were included for sample enrolment. The test positivity rate was conventional and liquid-based cytology (LBC) at cutoff ASCUS+ of 6.9 and 6.6%, respectively; PreTect HPV-Proofer of 7.3%; and consensus DNA PCR for 14 HR types of 18.5%. Sixteen cases of CIN2+ lesions were identified. Of these, conventional cytology identified 66.7% with a specificity of 96.2%, LBC identified 73.3% with a specificity of 96.9%, all at cutoff ASCUS+. HR-HPV DNA detected all CIN2+ cases with a specificity of 85.9%, whereas PreTect HPV-Proofer gave a sensitivity of 81.3% and a specificity of 96.6%.Both HPV detection assays showed a higher sensitivity for CIN2+ than did cytological methods. Detecting E6/E7 mRNA from only a subset of HR HPVs, as is the case with PreTect HPV-Proofer, resulted in a similar specificity to cytology and a significantly higher specificity than consensus HR HPV DNA (P<0.0001).Sensitivity, specificity, and clinical value of human papillomavirus (HPV) E6/E7 mRNA assay as a triage test for cervical cytology and HPV DNA test.There is evidence that testing for human papillomavirus (HPV) E6/E7 mRNA is more specific than testing for HPV DNA. A retrospective study was carried out to evaluate the performance of the PreTect HPV-Proofer E6/E7 mRNA assay (Norchip) as a triage test for cytology and HPV DNA testing. This study analyzed 1,201 women, 688 of whom had a colposcopy follow-up and 195 of whom had histology-confirmed high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia or worse (CIN2+). The proportion of positive results and the sensitivity and specificity for CIN2+ were determined for HPV mRNA in comparison to HPV DNA and cytology. All data were adjusted for follow-up completeness. Stratified by cytological grades, the HPV mRNA sensitivity was 83% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 63 to 94%) in ASC-US (atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance), 62% (95% CI = 47 to 75%) in L-SIL (low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion), and 67% (95% CI = 57 to 76%) in H-SIL (high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion). The corresponding figures were 99, 91, and 96%, respectively, for HPV DNA. The specificities were 82, 76, and 45%, respectively, for HPV mRNA and 29, 13, and 4%, respectively, for HPV DNA. Used as a triage test for ASC-US and L-SIL, mRNA reduced colposcopies by 79% (95% CI = 74 to 83%) and 69% (95% CI = 65 to 74%), respectively, while HPV DNA reduced colposcopies by 38% (95% CI = 32 to 44%) and by 15% (95% CI = 12 to 19%), respectively. As a HPV DNA positivity triage test, mRNA reduced colposcopies by 63% (95% CI = 60 to 66%), having 68% sensitivity (95% CI = 61 to 75%), whereas cytology at the ASC-US+ threshold reduced colposcopies by 23% (95% CI = 20 to 26%), showing 92% sensitivity (95% CI = 87 to 95%). In conclusion, PreTect HPV-Proofer mRNA can serve as a better triage test than HPV DNA to reduce colposcopy referral in both ASC-US and L-SIL. It is also more efficient than cytology for the triage of HPV DNA-positive women. Nevertheless, its low sensitivity demands a strict follow-up of HPV DNA positive-mRNA negative cases.
