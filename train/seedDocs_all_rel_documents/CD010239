Achieving targeted pulse oximetry values in preterm infants in the delivery room.To determine whether resuscitation teams can better maintain newborn transitional oxygen saturation (SpO₂) values within a prespecified target range using a graphical display of the targets and real-time SpO₂ data compared with using only numerical oximeter values.Preterm neonates were enrolled in this prospective cohort evaluation of a change in practice. The Transitional Oxygen Targeting System (TOTS) plots real-time SpO₂ values in relation to 10th and 50th percentile SpO₂ curves, which provides a visual target. After introduction of the TOTS, the resuscitation team adjusted the fraction of inspired oxygen to maintain the SpO₂ within the target range, and before its use neonates were resuscitated in attempt to target normal transitional SpO₂ values without using the TOTS monitor. Duration of time within 10th-50th percentile values was compared between 2 cohorts, children evaluated with the TOTS and those not evaluated with the TOTS (controls).A total of 40 infants were enrolled, including 20 prospectively evaluated with the TOTS and 20 controls. Mean gestational age, birth weight, total resuscitation time, duration of supplemental oxygen administration, changes in oxygen concentration, and respiratory support provided were similar in the 2 groups. The TOTS cohort spent 52% of time within the target range; the control cohort, 37% (P = .03).SpO₂ values were maintained within a specified target range for significantly longer in preterm neonates resuscitated using the TOTS display compared with those resuscitated without TOTS.Targeted Oxygen in the Resuscitation of Preterm Infants, a Randomized Clinical Trial. Lower concentrations of oxygen (O A randomized, unmasked study designed to determine major disability and death at 2 years in infants <32 weeks' gestation after delivery room resuscitation was initiated with either RA or 100% O Of 6291 eligible patients, 292 were recruited and 287 (mean gestation: 28.9 weeks) were included in the analysis (RA: n = 144; 100% O Using RA to initiate resuscitation was associated with an increased risk of death in infants <28 weeks' gestation. This study was not a prespecified analysis, and it was underpowered to address this post hoc hypothesis reliably. Additional data are needed.Resuscitation of preterm neonates by using room air or 100% oxygen.In this study of preterm neonates of <32 weeks, we prospectively compared the use of room air versus 100% oxygen as the initial resuscitation gas.A 2-center, prospective, randomized, controlled trial of neonates with gestational ages of 23 to 32 weeks who required resuscitation was performed. The oxygen group was initially resuscitated with 100% oxygen, with decreases in the fraction of inspired oxygen after 5 minutes of life if pulse oxygen saturation was >95%. The room air group was initially resuscitated with 21% oxygen, which was increased to 100% oxygen if compressions were performed or if the heart rate was <100 beats per minute at 2 minutes of life. Oxygen was increased in 25% increments if pulse oxygen saturation was <70% at 3 minutes of life or <80% at 5 minutes of life.Twenty-three infants in the oxygen group (mean gestational age: 27.6 weeks; range: 24-31 weeks; mean birth weight: 1013 g; range: 495-2309 g) and 18 in the room air group (mean gestational age: 28 weeks; range: 25-31 weeks; mean birth weight: 1091 g; range: 555-1840 g) were evaluated. Every resuscitated patient in the room air group met rescue criteria and received an increase in the fraction of inspired oxygen by 3 minutes of life, 6 patients directly to 100% and 12 with incremental increases. Pulse oxygen saturation was significantly lower in the room air group from 2 to 10 minutes (pulse oxygen saturation at 3 minutes: 55% in the room air group vs 87% in the oxygen group). Heart rates did not differ between groups in the first 10 minutes of life, and there were no differences in secondary outcomes.Resuscitation with room air failed to achieve our target oxygen saturation by 3 minutes of life, and we recommend that it not be used for preterm neonates.Resuscitation of very preterm infants with 30% vs. 65% oxygen at birth: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.Resuscitation at birth with 100% oxygen is known to increase the oxidative burden with concomitant deleterious effects. Although fractions of inspired oxygen (FiO₂) < 100% are widely used in preterm infants, starting resuscitation at a (too) low FiO₂ may result in hypoxia. The objective of this study is to compare the safety and efficacy of resuscitating very preterm infants with an initial FiO2 of 30% versus 65%.In this double-blind, randomized controlled trial, 200 very preterm infants with a gestational age < 32 weeks will be randomized to start resuscitation after birth with either 30% or 65% oxygen. The FiO₂ will be adjusted based on oxygen saturation measured by pulse oximetry (SpO₂) and pulse rate (which should be over 100 beats per minute) in order to achieve a target SpO₂ of 88-94% at 10 min of life. The FiO₂ and pulse oximetry data will be continuously recorded.The primary outcome is survival without bronchopulmonary dysplasia, as assessed by a physiological test at 36 weeks postmenstrual age. The secondary outcomes include the time to achieve SpO₂ > 88%, Apgar score at 5 min, cumulative O₂ exposure, oxidative stress (as determined by glutathione synthesis and oxidative stress markers), retinopathy of prematurity, brain injury and neurodevelopmental outcome at 2 years of age.This study will provide insight into determining the appropriate initial FiO₂ to start resuscitation of very preterm infants.http://www.trialregister.nl, NTR243.Survival and Neurodevelopmental Outcomes of Preterms Resuscitated With Different Oxygen Fractions. Stabilization of preterm infants after birth frequently requires oxygen supplementation. At present the optimal initial oxygen inspiratory fraction (Fio Randomized, controlled, double-blinded, multicenter, international clinical trial enrolling preterm infants <32 weeks' gestation assigned to an initial Fio A total of 253 infants were recruited and 206 (81.4%) completed follow-up. No differences in perinatal characteristics, oxidative stress, or morbidities during the neonatal period were assessed. Mortality at hospital discharge or when follow-up was completed didn't show differences between the groups. No differences regarding Bayley-III scale scores (motor, cognitive, and language composites), neurosensorial handicaps, cerebral palsy, or language skills between groups were found. The use of an initial lower (0.3) or higher (0.6-0.65) Fio Does the use of 50% oxygen at birth in preterm infants reduce lung injury?Bronchopulmonary dysplasia is an inflammatory fibrotic condition produced as a consequence of injurious influences in the neonatal lung. Exposing the premature lung to high concentrations of oxygen is thought to play an important part in lung injury pathogenesis.To see if the amount of oxygen used during resuscitation at birth triggers events that lead to the subsequent lung injury and if a reduction in oxygen used leads to a reduction in lung injury.The outcomes of newborn babies less than 31 weeks gestation who were resuscitated using either 50% or 100% oxygen were examined. Eight of the babies receiving 50% oxygen required an increase in their oxygen concentration. Evidence of pulmonary inflammation was determined by quantifying interleukin 6, 1beta, and 10 and tumour necrosis factor alpha in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay.There were no significant differences in any of the cytokines studied in either of the groups. Death occurred in 5/26 (19%) babies who received 100% oxygen and 4/26 (15%) babies who received 50% oxygen. Survival without bronchopulmonary dysplasia at 36 weeks postmenstrual age occurred in 14/26 (54%) and 13/26 (50%).Reducing the oxygen to 50% at resuscitation did not influence either short or long term outcomes, but a small benefit could not be excluded. There was no increase in adverse clinical outcomes in babies who received 100% oxygen.Room-air versus oxygen administration for resuscitation of preterm infants: the ROAR study.We conducted a blinded, prospective, randomized control trial to determine which oxygen-titration strategy was most effective at achieving and maintaining oxygen saturations of 85% to 92% during delivery-room resuscitation.Infants born at 32 weeks' gestation or less were resuscitated either with a static concentration of 100% oxygen (high-oxygen group) or using an oxygen-titration strategy starting from a concentration of 100% (moderate-oxygen group), or 21% oxygen (low-oxygen group). In the moderate- and low-oxygen groups, the oxygen concentration was adjusted by 20% every 15 seconds to reach a target oxygen saturation range of 85% to 92%. Treatment failure was defined as a heart rate slower than 100 beats per minute for longer than 30 seconds.The moderate-oxygen group spent a greater proportion of time in the target oxygen saturation range (mean: 0.21 [95% confidence interval: 0.16-0.26]) than the high-oxygen group (mean: 0.11 [95% confidence interval: 0.09-0.14]). Infants in the low-oxygen group were 8 times more likely to meet the criteria for treatment failure than those in the high-oxygen group (24% vs 3%; P = .022). The 3 groups did not differ significantly in the time to reach the target oxygen saturation range.Titrating from an initial oxygen concentration of 100% was more effective than giving a static concentration of 100% oxygen in maintaining preterm infants in a target oxygen saturation range. Initiating resuscitation with 21% oxygen resulted in a high treatment-failure rate.Resuscitating preterm infants with 100% oxygen is associated with higher oxidative stress than room air.The starting fraction of inspired oxygen for preterm resuscitation is a matter of debate, and the use of room air in full-term asphyxiated infants reduces oxidative stress. This study compared oxidative stress in preterm infants randomised for resuscitation with either 100% oxygen or room air titrated to internationally recommended levels of preductal oxygen saturations.Blood was collected at birth, two and 12 hours of age from 119 infants <32 weeks of gestation randomised to resuscitation with either 100% oxygen (n = 60) or room air (n = 59). Oxidative stress markers, including advanced oxidative protein products (AOPP) and isoprostanes (IsoP), were measured with high-performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry.Significantly higher levels of AOPP were found at 12 hours in the 100% oxygen group (p < 0.05). Increases between two- and 12-hour AOPP (p = 0.004) and IsoP (p = 0.032) concentrations were significantly higher in the 100% oxygen group.Initial resuscitation with room air versus 100% oxygen was associated with lower protein oxidation at 12 hour and a lower magnitude of increase in AOPP and IsoP levels between two and 12 hours of life. Correlations with clinical outcomes will be vital to optimise the use of oxygen in preterm resuscitation.Preterm resuscitation with low oxygen causes less oxidative stress, inflammation, and chronic lung disease.The goal was to reduce adverse pulmonary adverse outcomes, oxidative stress, and inflammation in neonates of 24 to 28 weeks of gestation initially resuscitated with fractions of inspired oxygen of 30% or 90%.Randomized assignment to receive 30% (N = 37) or 90% (N = 41) oxygen was performed. Targeted oxygen saturation values were 75% at 5 minutes and 85% at 10 minutes. Blood oxidized glutathione (GSSG)/reduced glutathione ratio and urinary o-tyrosine, 8-oxo-dihydroxyguanosine, and isoprostane levels, isofuran elimination, and plasma interleukin 8 and tumor necrosis factor alpha levels were determined.The low-oxygen group needed fewer days of oxygen supplementation (6 vs 22 days; P < .01) and fewer days of mechanical ventilation (13 vs 27 days; P < .01) and had a lower incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia at discharge (15.4% vs 31.7%; P < .05). GSSG/reduced glutathione x 100 ratios at day 1 and 3 were significantly higher in the high-oxygen group (day 1: high-oxygen group: 13.36 +/- 5.25; low-oxygen group: 8.46 +/- 3.87; P < .01; day 3: high-oxygen group: 8.87 +/- 4.40; low-oxygen group: 6.97 +/- 3.11; P < .05). Urinary markers of oxidative stress were increased significantly in the high-oxygen group, compared with the low-oxygen group, in the first week after birth. GSSG levels on day 3 and urinary isofuran, o-tyrosine, and 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine levels on day 7 were correlated significantly with development of chronic lung disease.Resuscitation of preterm neonates with 30% oxygen causes less oxidative stress, inflammation, need for oxygen, and risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia.Resuscitation of preterm neonates with limited versus high oxygen strategy.To determine whether a limited oxygen strategy (LOX) versus a high oxygen strategy (HOX) during delivery room resuscitation decreases oxidative stress in preterm neonates.A randomized trial of neonates of 24 to 34 weeks' gestational age (GA) who received resuscitation was performed. LOX neonates received room air as the initial resuscitation gas, and fraction of inspired oxygen (Fio2) was adjusted by 10% every 30 seconds to achieve target preductal oxygen saturations (Spo2) as described by the 2010 Neonatal Resuscitation Program guidelines. HOX neonates received 100% O2 as initial resuscitation gas, and Fio2 was adjusted by 10% to keep preductal Spo2 at 85% to 94%. Total hydroperoxide (TH), biological antioxidant potential (BAP), and the oxidative balance ratio (BAP/TH) were analyzed in cord blood and the first hour of life. Secondary outcomes included delivery room interventions, respiratory support on NICU admission, and short-term morbidities.Forty-four LOX (GA: 30 ± 3 weeks; birth weight: 1678 ± 634 g) and 44 HOX (GA: 30 ± 3 weeks; birth weight: 1463 ± 606 g) neonates were included. LOX decreased integrated excess oxygen (∑Fio2 × time [min]) in the delivery room compared with HOX (401 ± 151 vs 662 ± 249; P < .01). At 1 hour of life, BAP/TH was 60% higher for LOX versus HOX neonates (13 [9-16] vs 8 [6-9]) µM/U.CARR, P < .01). LOX decreased ventilator days (3 [0-64] vs 8 [0-96]; P < .05) and reduced the incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (7% vs 25%; P < .05).LOX is feasible and results in less oxygen exposure, lower oxidative stress, and decreased respiratory morbidities and thus is a reasonable alternative for resuscitation of preterm neonates in the delivery room.Achievement of targeted saturation values in extremely low gestational age neonates resuscitated with low or high oxygen concentrations: a prospective, randomized trial.Extremely low gestational age neonates have very low oxygen saturation in utero and an immature antioxidant defense system. Abrupt increases in oxygen saturation after birth may cause oxidative stress. We compared achievement of a targeted oxygen saturation of 85% at 10 minutes of life when resuscitation was initiated with low or high fractions of inspired oxygen and levels were adjusted according to preductal pulse oxygen saturation values.A prospective, randomized, clinical trial was performed in 2 level III neonatal referral units. Patients of < or = 28 weeks of gestation who required active resuscitation were randomly assigned to the low-oxygen group (fraction of inspired oxygen: 30%) or the high-oxygen group (fraction of inspired oxygen: 90%). Every 60 to 90 seconds, the fraction of inspired oxygen was increased in 10% steps if bradycardia occurred (< 100 beats per minute) or was decreased in similar steps if pulse oxygen saturation reached values of > 85%. Preductal pulse oxygen saturation was continuously monitored.The fraction of inspired oxygen in the low-oxygen group was increased stepwise to 45% and that in the high-oxygen group was reduced to 45% to reach a stable pulse oxygen saturation of approximately 85% at 5 to 7 minutes in both groups. No differences in oxygen saturation in minute-to-minute registers were found independent of the initial fraction of inspired oxygen used 4 minutes after cord clamping. No differences in mortality rates in the early neonatal period were detected.Resuscitation can be safely initiated for extremely low gestational age neonates with a low fraction of inspired oxygen (approximately 30%), which then should be adjusted to the infant's needs, reducing the oxygen load to the neonate.Resuscitation of preterm infants with different inspired oxygen fractions.To test the hypothesis that an initial fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 30% during resuscitation of preterm infants results in less oxidative stress and is associated with improved clinical outcomes compared with an FiO2 of 65%.Preterm infants of gestational age <32 weeks (n = 193) were randomized to start resuscitation with either 30% oxygen (low-oxygen group) or 65% oxygen (high-oxygen group), after which the FiO2 was adjusted based on oxygen saturation values. The primary outcome was bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) assessed at 36 weeks postmenstrual age. Secondary outcomes included major neonatal illnesses and markers of oxidative stress.The median gestational age of included infants was 28(6)/7 weeks (IQR, 26(5)/7-30(3)/7 weeks). The incidence of BPD was not significantly different between the low-oxygen and high-oxygen groups (24% vs. 17%; P = .15). The FiO2 in both groups was adjusted to a mean of 40% by 7 minutes in the low-oxygen group and by 11 minutes in the high-oxygen group. No differences in markers of oxidative stress were noted between groups.Initial supplementation of preterm infants with 30% oxygen during the fetal-to-neonatal transition is as safe as 65% oxygen, with no differences in oxidative stress markers or BPD.
