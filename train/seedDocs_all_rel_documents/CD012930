Efficacy and safety of umeclidinium plus vilanterol versus tiotropium, vilanterol, or umeclidinium monotherapies over 24 weeks in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: results from two multicentre, blinded, randomised controlled trials.Combination long-acting bronchodilator treatment might be more effective than long-acting bronchodilator monotherapy for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). We aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of umeclidinium (UMEC) plus vilanterol (VI) with tiotropium (TIO) monotherapy, UMEC monotherapy, or VI monotherapy in patients with moderate to very severe COPD.In two multicentre, randomised, blinded, double-dummy, parallel-group, active-controlled trials, eligible patients (current or former smokers aged 40 years or older with an established clinical history of COPD) were randomly assigned in 1:1:1:1 ratio to UMEC 125 μg plus VI 25 μg, UMEC 62·5 μg plus VI 25 μg, TIO 18 μg, and either VI 25 μg (study 1) or UMEC 125 μg (study 2). All study drugs were used once daily for 24 weeks. TIO was delivered via the HandiHaler inhaler and all other active treatments were delivered via the ELLIPTA dry powder inhaler. Random assignment (by a validated computer-based system) was done by centre and was not stratified. All patients and physicians were masked to assigned treatment during the studies. The primary efficacy endpoint of both studies was trough forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) on day 169, which was analysed in the intention-to-treat population. Both studies are registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, numbers NCT01316900 (study 1) and NCT01316913 (study 2).1141 participants were recruited in study 1, and 1191 in study 2. For study 1, after exclusions, 208, 209, 214, and 212 patients were included in the intention-to-treat analyses for TIO monotherapy, VI monotherapy, UMEC 125 μg plus VI 25 μg, and UMEC 62·5 μg plus VI 25 μg, respectively. For study 2, 215, 222, 215, and 217 patients were included in the intention-to-treat analyses for TIO monotherapy, UMEC monotherapy, UMEC 125 μg plus VI 25 μg, and UMEC 62·5 μg plus VI 25 μg, respectively. In both studies, we noted improvements in trough FEV1 on day 169 for both doses of UMEC plus VI compared with TIO monotherapy (study 1, UMEC 125 μg plus VI 25 μg: 0·088 L [95% CI 0·036 to 0·140; p=0·0010]; study 1, UMEC 62·5 μg plus VI 25 μg: 0·090 L [0·039 to 0·141; p=0·0006]; study 2, UMEC 125 μg plus VI 25 μg: 0·074 L [0·025 to 0·123; p=0·0031]; study 2, UMEC 62·5 μg plus VI 25 μg: 0·060 L [0·010 to 0·109; nominal p=0·0182]). Both doses of UMEC plus VI also improved trough FEV1 compared with VI monotherapy (UMEC 125 μg plus VI 25 μg: 0·088 L [0·036 to 0·140; p=0·0010]; UMEC 62·5 μg plus VI 25 μg: 0·090 L [0·039 to 0·142; p=0·0006], but not compared with UMEC 125 μg monotherapy (UMEC 125 μg plus VI 25 μg: 0·037 L [-0·012 to 0·087; p=0·14]; UMEC 62·5 μg plus VI 25 μg: 0·022 L [-0·027 to 0·072; p=0·38]). All treatments produced improvements in dyspnoea and health-related quality of life; we noted no significant differences in symptoms, health status, or risk of exacerbation between UMEC plus VI and TIO. The most common on-treatment, severe-intensity adverse event in both studies was acute exacerbation of COPD (1-4 [<1-2%] patients across treatment groups in study 1 and 1-6 [<1-3%] patients in study 2). We recorded five to 15 (2-7%) on-treatment serious adverse events across treatment groups in study 1, and nine to 22 (4-10%) in study 2. We noted no substantial changes from baseline in vital signs, clinical laboratory findings, or electrocardiography findings in any of the treatment groups.Combination treatment with once-daily UMEC plus VI improved lung function compared with VI monotherapy and TIO monotherapy in patients with COPD. Overall our results suggest that the combination of UMEC plus VI could be beneficial for the treatment of moderate to very severe COPD.GlaxoSmithKline.Formoterol and tiotropium compared with tiotropium alone for treatment of COPD.Combined use of beta(2)-agonists and anticholinergic bronchodilators may have complementary benefits in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The objective of this study was to compare combination treatment with formoterol (FORM) plus tiotropium (TIO) versus treatment with TIO alone in patients with COPD. In this active-controlled, double-blind, multicenter trial, a total of 255 subjects with diagnosed COPD were randomized to 12 weeks of either a combination of FORM 12 microg twice-daily plus TIO 18 microg once-daily in the morning (QD AM) or monotherapy with TIO 18 microg QD AM. The primary efficacy variable was the area under the curve for forced expiratory volume in 1 second measured 0 to 4 hours after AM dosing (FEV(1) AUC(0-4h)). Significantly greater improvements in the FEV(1) AUC(0-4h) were seen with FORM + TIO (n = 116) versus TIO (n = 124) at all time points. The increase in FEV(1) 5 minutes after the first dose was 180 mL with FORM + TIO versus 40 mL with TIO (p < 0.001). At endpoint, FEV(1) AUC(0-4h) increased 340 mL with FORM + TIO versus 170 mL with TIO (p < 0.001). Improvements in trough FEV(1) with FORM + TIO versus TIO were 180 mL and 100 mL, respectively (p < 0.01). Significantly greater reductions from baseline in symptom scores (p < 0.05) and daytime albuterol use (p < 0.04) were seen at endpoint with combination FORM + TIO versus TIO monotherapy. Both treatments were well tolerated. This study demonstrated that concurrent treatment with FORM + TIO results in greater therapeutic benefits than TIO alone.Once-daily umeclidinium/vilanterol 125/25 mcg in COPD: a randomized, controlled study.Combination long-acting bronchodilator therapy may be more effective than long-acting bronchodilator monotherapy in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).To compare the efficacy and safety of once-daily umeclidinium/vilanterol (UMEC/VI) 125/25 mcg with placebo and UMEC or VI monotherapy in COPD.This was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study. A total of 1493 patients were randomized (3:3:3:2) to 24 weeks of treatment with UMEC/VI 125/25 mcg, UMEC 125 mcg, VI 25 mcg, or placebo once-daily via dry powder inhaler.Primary efficacy endpoint was trough forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) on Day 169 (23-24 h post-dose). Additional lung-function, symptomatic and health-related quality of life endpoints were also assessed. Safety evaluations included: adverse events, vital signs, electrocardiography and clinical laboratory measurements. All active treatments significantly improved trough FEV1 vs placebo (0.124-0.238 L, all p<0.001). Improvements with UMEC/VI 125/25 mcg were significantly greater than for UMEC 125 mcg or VI 25 mcg (0.079 L and 0.114 L; both p≤0.001). Improvements for UMEC/VI 125/25 mcg vs placebo were observed for the transition dyspnea index (1.0 unit; p<0.001), rescue albuterol use at Weeks 1-24 (-1.5 puffs/day) and St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (-3.60 units, p<0.001). No safety signals were observed.Once-daily UMEC/VI 125/25 mcg was well tolerated and provided greater improvements in lung function, health status, and dyspnea scores compared with monotherapy components and placebo over 24 weeks. This study supports the use of UMEC/VI 125/25 mcg for the maintenance treatment of COPD.protocol number: DB2113361; ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01313637.24-h bronchodilation and inspiratory capacity improvements with glycopyrrolate/formoterol fumarate via co-suspension delivery technology in COPD.Symptoms of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease may vary throughout the day and it is important that therapeutic approaches provide 24-h symptom control. We report the results of two phase IIIb crossover studies, PT003011 and PT003012, investigating the 24-h lung function profile of GFF MDI (glycopyrrolate/formoterol fumarate 18/9.6 μg delivered using innovative co-suspension delivery technology) administered twice daily.Patients with moderate-to-very severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease received 4 weeks' treatment with each of GFF MDI, placebo MDI, and open-label tiotropium (PT003011 only). Lung function was assessed over 24 h on day 29 of each treatment period. The primary outcome was forced expiratory volume in 1 second area under the curve from 0 to 24 h (FEVGFF MDI treatment significantly increased FEVGFF MDI significantly improved 24-h lung function versus placebo in patients with moderate-to-very severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, with similar benefits in the second 12-h period compared to the first, supporting twice-daily dosing of GFF MDI.Pearl Therapeutics, Inc.; www.clinicaltrials.gov ; NCT02347072 and NCT02347085 . Registered 21 January 2015.Efficacy and safety of tiotropium + olodaterol maintenance treatment in patients with COPD in the TONADOIncreasing age is associated with poor prognosis in patients with COPD.This analysis from the replicate Phase III OTEMTOIn these double-blind, parallel-group, active-controlled, multicenter, randomized studies, patients received tiotropium + olodaterol 2.5/5 μg or 5/5 μg, tiotropium 5 μg or 2.5 μg (TONADO only), olodaterol 5 μg (TONADO only), or placebo (OTEMTO only). This analysis used the approved doses of tiotropium + olodaterol 5/5 μg, tiotropium 5 μg, and olodaterol 5 μg. Primary end points at 12 weeks (OTEMTO) or 24 weeks (TONADO) included St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) total score, forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEVA total of 1,621 patients were randomized (40 years to <65 years, n=749; 65 years to <75 years, n=674; 75 years to <85 years, n=186; ≥85 years, n=12) in OTEMTO and 5,162 patients (40 years to <65 years, n=2,654; 65 years to <75 years, n=1,967; 75 to <85 years, n=528; ≥85 years, n=13) in TONADO. FEVNo differences were noted in relative responses to treatment or safety when using tiotropium + olodaterol 5/5 μg compared to monotherapies or placebo across all age groups.Effect of QVA149 on lung volumes and exercise tolerance in COPD patients: the BRIGHT study.QVA149 is a novel, inhaled, once-daily dual bronchodilator containing a fixed-dose combination of the long-acting β2-agonist indacaterol and the long-acting muscarinic antagonist glycopyrronium (NVA237), for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This study evaluated the effects of QVA149 on exercise tolerance, hyperinflation, lung function and lung volumes versus placebo and tiotropium.Patients with moderate-to-severe COPD were randomized to QVA149 110/50 μg, placebo or tiotropium 18 μg once daily in a blinded, 3-period crossover study for 3 weeks. The primary endpoint was exercise endurance time at Day 21 for QVA149 versus placebo.Eighty-five patients were randomized; 86% completed the study. QVA149 significantly improved exercise endurance time at Day 21 compared with placebo (least squares mean treatment difference 60 s [p = 0.006]). No significant improvements in exercise endurance time at Day 21 between QVA149 and tiotropium were found. Dynamic inspiratory capacity (IC) at exercise isotime, trough forced expiratory volume in 1 s, residual volume and functional residual capacity showed significant improvements with QVA149 from Day 1 of treatment that were maintained throughout the study. The safety profiles were similar across groups.In patients with moderate-to-severe COPD, once-daily QVA149 significantly improved exercise endurance time compared with placebo which was associated with sustained reductions of lung hyperinflation as indicated by significant improvement in IC at rest and during exercise.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01294787.Dual bronchodilation with QVA149 decreases lung hyperinflation and improves exercise tolerance and lung function in patients with moderate-to-severe COPD.The efficacy of aclidinium/formoterol on lung function and symptoms in patients with COPD categorized by symptom status: a pooled analysis.Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) experience respiratory symptoms, which impair quality of life. This pooled analysis of two Phase III studies assessed the impact of aclidinium/formoterol on patients with COPD categorized by symptom status.Data were pooled from two 24-week, randomized, placebo-controlled studies of twice-daily aclidinium/formoterol 400/12 µg in moderate-to-severe COPD (ACLIFORM [NCT01462942] and AUGMENT [NCT01437397]). These post hoc analyses evaluated the efficacy of aclidinium/formoterol versus placebo or monotherapies in patients defined as less/more symptomatic by a) Evaluating Respiratory Symptoms (E-RS™) score ≥10/<10 and b) Baseline Dyspnea Index score <7/≥7. Endpoints included trough and 1-hour morning postdose forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), Transition Dyspnea Index, E-RS total score, early-morning and nighttime symptom severity, early-morning limitation of activities, and exacerbation rate.Data for 3,394 patients were analyzed (mean age: 63.5 years; 60.5% male). In both definitions of less and more symptomatic patients, aclidinium/formoterol improved 1-hour morning postdose FEV1 from baseline at week 24 versus placebo (P<0.001) and both monotherapies (P<0.05). Aclidinium/formoterol improved trough FEV1 from baseline in both groups versus placebo (P<0.05) and formoterol (P<0.05); improvements were greater in more symptomatic patients. Improvements versus aclidinium were also observed in more symptomatic patients (P<0.05). Aclidinium/formoterol improved dyspnea, early-morning symptom severity, and limitation of activities versus placebo in both less and more symptomatic patients (P<0.001). In more symptomatic patients, aclidinium/formoterol also improved E-RS total score and severity of nighttime symptoms from baseline versus placebo and one or both monotherapies (P<0.05). The rate of moderate/severe exacerbations was reduced with aclidinium/formoterol versus placebo in more symptomatic patients.Aclidinium/formoterol 400/12 µg provided consistent improvements in bronchodilation and symptoms versus monotherapies and reduced exacerbations versus placebo in more symptomatic patients with moderate-to-severe COPD, regardless of the definition used. Furthermore, patients with a low symptom burden achieved benefits with aclidinium/formoterol versus monotherapies in postdose FEV1, dyspnea, and early-morning symptoms.Tiotropium and olodaterol fixed-dose combination versus mono-components in COPD (GOLD 2-4).Efficacy and safety of tiotropium+olodaterol fixed-dose combination (FDC) compared with the mono-components was evaluated in patients with moderate to very severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in two replicate, randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, multicentre, phase III trials. Patients received tiotropium+olodaterol FDC 2.5/5 μg or 5/5 μg, tiotropium 2.5 μg or 5 μg, or olodaterol 5 μg delivered once-daily via Respimat inhaler over 52 weeks. Primary end points were forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) area under the curve from 0 to 3 h (AUC0-3) response, trough FEV1 response and St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) total score at 24 weeks. In total, 5162 patients (2624 in Study 1237.5 and 2538 in Study 1237.6) received treatment. Both FDCs significantly improved FEV1 AUC0-3 and trough FEV1 response versus the mono-components in both studies. Statistically significant improvements in SGRQ total score versus the mono-components were only seen for tiotropium+olodaterol FDC 5/5 μg. Incidence of adverse events was comparable between the FDCs and the mono-components. These studies demonstrated significant improvements in lung function and health-related quality of life with once-daily tiotropium+olodaterol FDC versus mono-components over 1 year in patients with moderate to very severe COPD.Efficacy and safety of indacaterol/glycopyrronium in Japanese patients with COPD: Pooled analysis of SHINE and ARISE.To better evaluate the efficacy and safety of the indacaterol/glycopyrronium (IND/GLY) fixed-dose combination versus tiotropium in Japanese patients, a pooled data analysis was conducted from the SHINE and ARISE studies, which were part of the IND/GLY clinical trial program.Japanese patients with moderate-to-severe COPD were included in the analysis. Efficacy in terms of pre-dose forced expiratory volume in one second (FEVIn total, 340 patients (IND/GLY, n=161; IND, n=41; GLY, n=40; tiotropium, n=79; and placebo, n=19) were included in the analysis that focused on comparing IND/GLY versus tiotropium since they were included in both studies. At Week 12 and Week 24/26, pre-dose FEVCompared to tiotropium, IND/GLY provided significant improvements in lung function, health status, and rescue medication use, while having a good safety profile in Japanese patients with moderate-to-severe COPD.Effects of a combination of umeclidinium/vilanterol on exercise endurance in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: two randomized, double-blind clinical trials.Exercise intolerance is a hallmark of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).Patients with COPD were randomized in two multicentre, double-blind, incomplete block crossover studies. Patients received two of six treatments in sequence (12 weeks each): placebo, umeclidinium (UMEC)/vilanterol (VI) (125/25 mcg or 62.5/25 mcg), VI (25 mcg) or UMEC (62.5 mcg or 125 mcg). Exercise endurance time (EET) and trough forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) (Week 12) were co-primary endpoints. Safety was monitored throughout.Both studies showed similar 3-hour post-dose EET improvements from baseline for UMEC/VI (Week 12). Significant EET improvements were observed with both UMEC/VI doses versus placebo at Week 12 in Study 418 (UMEC/VI 125/25 mcg: 65.8 s; p = 0.005; UMEC/VI 62.5/25 mcg: 69.4 s; p = 0.003), but not in Study 417, where a placebo effect was evident. Post hoc integrated data analysis showed significant but smaller EET improvements for both UMEC/VI doses versus placebo at Week 12 (UMEC/VI 125/25 mcg: 47.5 s; p = 0.002; UMEC/VI 62.5/25 mcg: 43.7 s; p = 0.001). Both studies showed trough FEV1 improvements at Week 12 for both UMEC/VI doses. The incidence of adverse events was similar between treatment groups within each study.UMEC/VI improved lung function and EET.Enhancing exercise tolerance and physical activity in COPD with combined pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions: PHYSACTO randomised, placebo-controlled study design.Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is associated with exercise limitation and physical inactivity, which are believed to have significant long-term negative health consequences for patients. While a number of COPD treatments and exercise training programmes increase exercise capacity, there is limited evidence for their effects on physical activity levels, with no clear association between exercise capacity and physical activity in clinical trials. Physical activity depends on a number of behaviour, environmental and physiological factors. We describe the design of the PHYSACTO trial, which is investigating the effects of bronchodilators, either alone or with exercise training, in combination with a standardised behaviour-change self-management programme, on exercise capacity and physical activity in patients with COPD. It is hypothesised that bronchodilators in conjunction with a behaviour-change self-management programme will improve physical activity and that this effect will be amplified by the addition of exercise training.Patients are being recruited from 34 sites in Australia, New Zealand, the USA, Canada and Europe. Patients receiving a multicomponent intervention designed to support behaviour change related to physical activity are randomised to four treatment arms: placebo, tiotropium, tiotropium+olodaterol, and tiotropium+olodaterol+exercise training. The primary outcome is improvement in exercise capacity after 8 weeks, measured by endurance time during a shuttle walk test. The secondary outcome is improvement in physical activity, including objective accelerometer assessment and patient-reported functioning using the Functional Performance Inventory-Short Form and the novel hybrid PROactive instrument. Additionally, the influence of moderating variables (ie, factors influencing a patient's choice to be physically active) on increases in physical activity is also explored.The study has been approved by the relevant Institutional Review Boards, Independent Ethics Committee and Competent Authority according to national and international regulations. The findings of the trial will be disseminated through relevant peer-reviewed journals and international conference presentations.NCT02085161.Efficacy and safety of fixed-dose combinations of aclidinium bromide/formoterol fumarate: the 24-week, randomized, placebo-controlled AUGMENT COPD study.Combining two long-acting bronchodilators with complementary mechanisms of action may provide treatment benefits to patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) that are greater than those derived from either treatment alone. The efficacy and safety of a fixed-dose combination (FDC) of aclidinium bromide, a long-acting muscarinic antagonist, and formoterol fumarate, a long-acting β2-agonist, in patients with moderate to severe COPD are presented.In this 24-week double-blind study, 1692 patients with stable COPD were equally randomized to twice-daily treatment with FDC aclidinium 400 μg/formoterol 12 μg (ACL400/FOR12 FDC), FDC aclidinium 400 μg/formoterol 6 μg (ACL400/FOR6 FDC), aclidinium 400 μg, formoterol 12 μg, or placebo administered by a multidose dry powder inhaler (Genuair®/Pressair®)*. Coprimary endpoints were change from baseline to week 24 in 1-hour morning postdose FEV1 (FDCs versus aclidinium) and change from baseline to week 24 in morning predose (trough) FEV1 (FDCs versus formoterol). Secondary endpoints were change from baseline in St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) total score and improvement in Transition Dyspnea Index (TDI) focal score at week 24. Safety and tolerability were also assessed.At study end, improvements from baseline in 1-hour postdose FEV1 were significantly greater in patients treated with ACL400/FOR12 FDC or ACL400/FOR6 FDC compared with aclidinium (108 mL and 87 mL, respectively; p < 0.0001). Improvements in trough FEV1 were significantly greater in patients treated with ACL400/FOR12 FDC versus formoterol (45 mL; p = 0.0102), a numerical improvement of 26 mL in trough FEV1 over formoterol was observed with ACL400/FOR6 FDC. Significant improvements in both SGRQ total and TDI focal scores were observed in the ACL400/FOR12 FDC group at study end (p < 0.0001), with differences over placebo exceeding the minimal clinically important difference of ≥4 points and ≥1 unit, respectively. All treatments were well tolerated, with safety profiles of the FDCs similar to those of the monotherapies.Treatment with twice-daily aclidinium 400 μg/formoterol 12 μg FDC provided rapid and sustained bronchodilation that was greater than either monotherapy; clinically significant improvements in dyspnea and health status were evident compared with placebo. Aclidinium/formoterol FDC may be an effective and well tolerated new treatment option for patients with COPD.Clinicaltrials.gov NCT01437397.Efficacy and safety of once-daily QVA149 compared with the free combination of once-daily tiotropium plus twice-daily formoterol in patients with moderate-to-severe COPD (QUANTIFY): a randomised, non-inferiority study.QVA149 is a once-daily (o.d.) inhaled dual bronchodilator containing a fixed-dose combination of the long-acting β2-agonist indacaterol and the long-acting muscarinic antagonist glycopyrronium for the treatment of COPD. The QUANTIFY study compared QVA149 with a free-dose bronchodilator combination of tiotropium plus formoterol (TIO+FOR) in improving health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of patients with COPD.This multicentre, blinded, triple-dummy, parallel-group, non-inferiority study randomised patients aged ≥40 years with moderate-to-severe COPD (post-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) ≥30% to <80% predicted) to QVA149 110/50 µg o.d. or TIO 18 µg o.d.+ FOR 12 µg twice daily (1:1) for 26 weeks. The primary endpoint was to demonstrate non-inferiority in HRQoL assessed using St George's Respiratory Questionnaire-COPD (SGRQ-C). The prespecified non-inferiority margin was 4 units. Secondary endpoints included Transition Dyspnoea Index (TDI) score, pre-dose FEV1, forced vital capacity (FVC) and safety.Of the 934 patients randomised (QVA149=476 and TIO+FOR=458), 87.9% completed the study. At week 26, non-inferiority was met for SGRQ-C (QVA149 vs TIO+FOR; difference: -0.69 units; 95% CI -2.31 to 0.92; p=0.399). A significantly higher percentage of patients achieved a clinically relevant ≥1 point improvement in TDI total score with QVA149 (49.6%) versus TIO+FOR (42.4%; p=0.033). QVA149 significantly increased pre-dose FEV1 (+68 mL, 95% CI 37 mL to 100 mL; p<0.001) and FVC (+74 mL, 95% CI 24 mL to 125 mL; p=0.004) compared with TIO+FOR at week 26. The incidence of adverse events was comparable between both treatments (QVA149=43.7% and TIO+FOR=42.6%).QVA149 is non-inferior to TIO+FOR in improving HRQoL, with clinically meaningful and significant improvements in breathlessness and lung function in patients with COPD.NCT01120717.Cardiovascular safety of QVA149, a combination of Indacaterol and NVA237, in COPD patients.This study assessed the cardiovascular safety of QVA149, an inhaled, once daily, bronchodilator combination containing two 24-hour bronchodilators, the long-acting β(2)-agonist indacaterol and the long-acting muscarinic antagonist glycopyrronium (NVA237). In this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study, 257 patients with moderate-to-severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) were randomised to receive QVA149 (indacaterol/NVA237) 600/100 microg, 300/100 microg or 150/100 microg, indacaterol 300 μg or placebo, once daily for 14 days. The primary endpoint was change from baseline in 24-h mean heart rate versus placebo on Day 14. 255 patients were included in the safety analysis (mean age 63.8 years, 76.5% male, post-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in one second [FEV(1)] 53.2% predicted, FEV(1)/FVC [forced vital capacity] 50.0%, mean 24-h heart rate 79.6 bpm). There were no clinically significant differences in the 24-h mean heart rate on Day 14 between the three doses of QVA149 and placebo or indacaterol. The confidence intervals of these treatment differences (contrasts) were within the pre-specified equivalence limit (-5 to 5 bpm). No clinically relevant differences in QTc interval (Fridericia's) were observed between groups on Days 1, 7 and 14. Once-daily QVA149 was well tolerated in COPD patients with a cardiovascular safety profile and overall adverse event rates similar to placebo.Behaviour-change intervention in a multicentre, randomised, placebo-controlled COPD study: methodological considerations and implementation.Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is generally progressive and associated with reduced physical activity. Both pharmacological therapy and exercise training can improve exercise capacity; however, these are often not sufficient to change the amount of daily physical activity a patient undertakes. Behaviour-change self-management programmes are designed to address this, including setting motivational goals and providing social support. We present and discuss the necessary methodological considerations when integrating behaviour-change interventions into a multicentre study.PHYSACTO is a 12-week phase IIIb study assessing the effects on exercise capacity and physical activity of once-daily tiotropium+olodaterol 5/5 µg with exercise training, tiotropium+olodaterol 5/5 µg without exercise training, tiotropium 5 µg or placebo, with all pharmacological interventions administered via the Respimat inhaler. Patients in all intervention arms receive a behaviour-change self-management programme to provide an optimal environment for translating improvements in exercise capacity into increases in daily physical activity. To maximise the likelihood of success, special attention is given in the programme to: (1) the Site Case Manager, with careful monitoring of programme delivery; (2) the patient, incorporating patient-evaluation/programme-evaluation measures to guide the Site Case Manager in the self-management intervention; and (3) quality assurance, to help identify and correct any problems or shortcomings in programme delivery and ensure the effectiveness of any corrective steps.

However, there may be racial differences in the effects of T+O on lung function in patients with COPD.In this Tonado(®) subgroup analysis, we assessed efficacy and safety of T+O in Japanese participants.Versus the overall population, the 413 Japanese patients randomized and treated were slightly older, with more men, lower body mass index, lower baseline St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) scores, fewer current smokers, but with higher pack-year smoking history. A lower proportion of Japanese patients used inhaled corticosteroids, short-acting muscarinic antagonists, or short- or long-acting β-adrenergic agonists at baseline, but use of long-acting muscarinic antagonists was higher. At Week 24, mean improvements with T+O 5/5 μg in forced expiratory volume in 1 second area under the curve from 0-3 hours response were 151 mL versus olodaterol and 134 mL versus tiotropium 5 μg; mean improvements with T+O 2.5/5 μg were 87 mL versus olodaterol and 70 mL versus tiotropium 2.5 μg. Mean improvements with T+O 5/5 μg in trough forced expiratory volume in 1 second were 131 mL versus olodaterol and 108 mL versus tiotropium 5 μg; mean improvements with T+O 2.5/5 μg were 60 mL versus olodaterol and 47 mL versus tiotropium 2.5 μg. SGRQ scores improved from baseline to a greater extent with both doses of T+O versus monotherapies. Responses were similar in the overall population. Adverse-event incidence was generally balanced across treatment groups.Consistent with results from the overall population, T+O 5/5 μg was superior to each monotherapy for lung function and SGRQ in the Japanese sub-population of patients with COPD in Tonado(®).Safety and efficacy of dual bronchodilation with QVA149 in COPD patients: the ENLIGHTEN study.QVA149 is an inhaled, once-daily fixed-dose dual bronchodilator combination of the long-acting β2-agonist indacaterol and long-acting muscarinic antagonist glycopyrronium (NVA237) for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). We investigated the safety and efficacy of QVA149 over 52 weeks.This 52-week, multicenter, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled study randomized (2:1) patients with moderate-to-severe COPD to once-daily QVA149 (110 μg indacaterol/50 μg glycopyrronium) or placebo delivered via the Breezhaler device. Primary endpoint was safety and tolerability for treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs). Secondary endpoints included safety based on vital signs, electrocardiograms (ECGs), laboratory evaluations, and pre-dose forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1).Of 339 patients randomized, QVA149 [n = 226], placebo [n = 113]; 76.9% male, mean age: 62.6 years, post-bronchodilator FEV1: 57.4% predicted, 83.5% completed study. A smaller percentage of patients discontinued in the QVA149 group (14.2%) compared with placebo (21.2%). Overall incidence of AEs was similar in the QVA149 (57.8%) and placebo (56.6%) groups, with most AEs being mild to moderate in severity. The numerical differences in some AEs observed could be at least in part explained by differences in baseline patient characteristics. No clinically relevant differences were observed between treatment groups for vital signs or ECG parameters. The five deaths reported were unrelated to study medication (QVA149, n = 4 [1.8%]; placebo, n = 1 [0.9%]). QVA149 demonstrated rapid and clinically meaningful bronchodilation sustained over 52 weeks versus placebo.QVA149 demonstrated a good safety and tolerability profile, providing rapid and sustained bronchodilation over 52 weeks in patients with moderate-to-severe COPD. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01120717.Randomized, Double-Blind, Dose-Finding Study for Tiotropium when Added to Olodaterol, Administered via the Respimat® Inhaler in Patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease.Combining long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs) and long-acting β2-agonists (LABAs) is beneficial in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), as the two classes of bronchodilator have complementary modes of action. The optimal dose for the fixed-dose combination of the LAMA tiotropium and the LABA olodaterol needed to be determined. In this phase II trial, the dose response of tiotropium on top of olodaterol was investigated in a free-dose combination, while other phase II studies have explored different doses of olodaterol on top of tiotropium, with both drugs delivered using the Respimat(®) inhaler.This was a double-blind incomplete crossover trial in which 233 patients with moderate or severe COPD were randomized to receive four out of eight free-dose combinations of olodaterol (5 or 10 µg) and tiotropium (1.25, 2.5, or 5 µg) or placebo for 4 weeks each. Primary end point was trough forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) change from baseline (response) after 4 weeks.Addition of tiotropium 1.25, 2.5, and 5 µg to olodaterol 5 µg increased mean trough FEV1 response by 0.054, 0.065, and 0.084 L, respectively; addition of tiotropium 1.25, 2.5, and 5 µg to olodaterol 10 µg increased mean trough FEV1 response by 0.051, 0.083, and 0.080 L, respectively. All treatments were well tolerated and incidence of adverse events was similar with all treatments.Overall, a dose response for tiotropium on top of both doses of olodaterol was observed, with increasing improvements in trough FEV1 compared to olodaterol alone as the tiotropium dose was increased.Boehringer Ingelheim.ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01040403.A randomized, parallel-group study to evaluate the efficacy of umeclidinium/vilanterol 62.5/25 μg on health-related quality of life in patients with COPD.The combination of the inhaled muscarinic antagonist umeclidinium (UMEC) with the long-acting β2-agonist vilanterol (VI) has been shown to provide significant improvements in lung function compared with UMEC, VI, or placebo (PBO) in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This study was specifically designed to support these findings by assessing health-related quality of life and symptomatic outcomes in a similar population.This was a 12-week multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled study. Eligible patients were randomized 1:1 to receive once-daily UMEC/VI 62.5/25 μg (via ELLIPTA(®) dry powder inhaler) or PBO for 12 weeks. The primary endpoint was St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) total score at day 84. Secondary efficacy endpoints included rescue albuterol use (puffs/day) over weeks 1-12 and trough forced expiratory volume in 1 second on day 84. Adverse events were also assessed.A total of 496 patients were included in the intent-to-treat population in the UMEC/VI (n=248) and PBO (n=248) treatment groups. UMEC/VI 62.5/25 μg provided a significant and clinically meaningful improvement in SGRQ total score at day 84 versus PBO (difference between treatments in SGRQ total score change from baseline: -4.03 [95% confidence interval {CI}: -6.28, -1.79]; P<0.001). UMEC/VI 62.5/25 μg resulted in a statistically significant reduction in rescue albuterol use versus PBO (-0.7 puffs/day [95% CI: -1.1, -0.4]; P<0.001). UMEC/VI 62.5/25 μg provided a significant and clinically meaningful improvement in trough forced expiratory volume in 1 second on day 84 versus PBO (122 mL [95% CI: 71, 172]; P<0.001). The incidence of adverse events was similar between treatments (32% and 30% of patients in the UMEC/VI 62.5/25 μg and PBO groups, respectively).The results of this study demonstrate that treatment with UMEC/VI 62.5/25 μg provides clinically important improvements in SGRQ and rescue medication use versus PBO in patients with moderate-to-very-severe COPD.Study Design of VESUTOThe superiority of tiotropium/olodaterol is demonstrated in improvement of lung function, dyspnea, lung hyperinflation, and quality of life compared with either monotherapy in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Japanese Respiratory Society Guidelines for COPD management include improvement of exercise tolerance and daily physical activity as the treatment goals; however, there is limited evidence in Japanese patients with COPD.A protocol is developed for the VESUTOA total of 180 Japanese patients with COPD, aged ≥40 years will be enrolled into the double-blind, multicenter, active-controlled, crossover study (NCT02629965) and will be randomized to receive either tiotropium/olodaterol FDC or tiotropium for 6 weeks each [two puffs via RESPIMATThe VESUTOClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02629965 (registered on December 1, 2015).The VESUTO study was funded by Nippon Boehringer Ingelheim Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan.Efficacy and safety of once-daily QVA149 compared with twice-daily salmeterol-fluticasone in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (ILLUMINATE): a randomised, double-blind, parallel group study.QVA149 is an inhaled fixed-dose combination therapy under development for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It combines indacaterol (a longacting β2-agonist) with glycopyrronium (a longacting muscarinic antagonist) as a dual bronchodilator. We aimed to compare the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of QVA149 versus salmeterol-fluticasone (SFC) over 26 weeks in patients with moderate-to-severe COPD.In this multicentre double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group study, 523 patients (age 40 years or older, Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease [GOLD] stages II-III, without exacerbations in the previous year) were randomly assigned (1:1; via automated, interactive response technology and stratified for smoking status) to once-daily QVA149 110/50 μg or twice-daily SFC 50/500 μg for 26 weeks. Efficacy was assessed in the full analysis set (randomised patients who received at least one dose of study drug); safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of study drug. The primary endpoint was to demonstrate the superiority of QVA149 compared with SFC for the standardised area under the curve from 0 to 12 h post dose for forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1 AUC0-12h) after 26 weeks of treatment. This trial was registered at ClinicalTrial.gov, NCT01315249.Between March 25, 2011, and March 12, 2012, 259 patients were randomly assigned to receive QVA149 and 264 to receive SFC. At week 26, FEV1 AUC0-12h was significantly higher with QVA149 than with SFC (treatment difference 0·138 L; 95% CI 0·100-0·176; p<0·0001). Overall incidence of adverse events (including COPD exacerbations) was 55·4% (143 of 258) for the QVA149 group and 60·2% (159 of 264) for the SFC group. Incidence of serious adverse events was similar between treatment groups (QVA149, 13 of 258 [5·0%]; SFC 14 of 264 [5·3%]); COPD worsening was the most frequent serious adverse event (one of 13 [0·4%] and three of 14 [1·1%], respectively).Once-daily QVA149 provides significant, sustained, and clinically meaningful improvements in lung function versus twice-daily SFC, with significant symptomatic benefit. These results indicate the potential of dual bronchodilation as a treatment option for non-exacerbating symptomatic COPD patients.Novartis Pharma AG.Dual bronchodilation with QVA149 versus single bronchodilator therapy: the SHINE study.We investigated the efficacy and safety of dual bronchodilation with QVA149 versus its monocomponents indacaterol and glycopyrronium, tiotropium and placebo in patients with moderate-to-severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This was a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled, 26-week trial. Patients (n = 2144) were randomised (2:2:2:2:1) to receive once-daily QVA149 (indacaterol 110 μg/glycopyrronium 50 μg), indacaterol 150 μg, glycopyrronium 50 μg, open-label tiotropium 18 μg or placebo. The primary end-point was trough forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) at week 26 for QVA149 versus its monocomponents. Secondary end-points included dyspnoea, health status, rescue medication use and safety. Trough FEV1 at week 26 was significantly improved (p<0.001) with QVA149 compared with indacaterol and glycopyrronium (least squares mean (LSM) differences 0.07 L and 0.09 L, respectively), tiotropium and placebo (LSM differences 0.08 L and 0.20 L, respectively); these beneficial effects were sustained throughout the 26-week study. QVA149 significantly improved dyspnoea and health status versus placebo (p<0.001 and p = 0.002, respectively) and tiotropium (p = 0.007 and p = 0.009, respectively) at week 26. All treatments were well tolerated. Dual bronchodilation with once-daily QVA149 demonstrated superior and clinically meaningful outcomes versus placebo and superiority versus treatment with a single bronchodilator, with a safety and tolerability profile similar to placebo, supporting the concept of fixed-dose long-acting muscarinic antagonist/long-acting β2-agonist combinations for the treatment of COPD. Blinded 12-week comparison of once-daily indacaterol and tiotropium in COPD.Two, once daily (q.d.) inhaled bronchodilators are available for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD): the β(2)-agonist indacaterol and the anticholinergic tiotropium. This blinded study compared the efficacy of these two agents and assessed their safety and tolerability. Patients with moderate-to-severe COPD were randomised to treatment with indacaterol 150 μg q.d. (n=797) or tiotropium 18 μg q.d. (n=801) for 12 weeks. After 12 weeks, the two treatments had similar overall effects on "trough" (24 h post-dose) forced expiratory volume in 1 s. Indacaterol-treated patients had greater improvements in transition dyspnoea index (TDI) total score (least squares means 2.01 versus 1.43; p<0.001) and St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) total score (least squares means 37.1 versus 39.2; p<0.001; raw mean change from baseline -5.1 versus -3.0), and were significantly more likely to achieve clinically relevant improvements in these end-points (indacaterol versus tiotropium odds ratios of 1.49 for TDI and 1.43 for SGRQ, both p<0.001). Adverse events were recorded for 39.7% and 37.2% of patients in the indacaterol and tiotropium treatment groups, respectively. The most frequent adverse events were COPD worsening, cough and nasopharyngitis. Both bronchodilators demonstrated spirometric efficacy. The two treatments were well tolerated with similar adverse event profiles. Compared with tiotropium, indacaterol provided significantly greater improvements in clinical outcomes.Dual bronchodilation with QVA149 reduces patient-reported dyspnoea in COPD: the BLAZE study.We evaluated the effect of QVA149, a dual bronchodilator combining indacaterol and glycopyrronium, on direct patient-reported dyspnoea in patients with moderate-to-severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. In this multicentre, blinded, double-dummy, three-period crossover study, 247 patients were randomised to once-daily QVA149 110/50 μg, placebo or tiotropium 18 μg. Superiority of QVA149 versus placebo (primary objective) and tiotropium (secondary objective) was assessed for improvement in dyspnoea via the self-administered computerised (SAC) version of the Baseline and Transition Dyspnoea Index after 6 weeks. Secondary end-points included lung function, rescue medication use and safety. After 6 weeks, the SAC Transition Dyspnoea Index total score was significantly higher with QVA149 versus placebo (least squares mean (LSM) treatment difference 1.37, p<0.001) and tiotropium (LSM treatment difference 0.49, p=0.021). QVA149 provided significant improvements in lung function, with higher forced expiratory volume in 1 s area under the curve from 0-4 h post-dose versus placebo and tiotropium at day 1 and week 6 (all p<0.001). Rescue medication use was significantly lower with QVA149 versus placebo (p<0.001) and tiotropium (p=0.002). All treatments were well tolerated. Once-daily QVA149 provided superior improvements in patient-reported dyspnoea and lung function versus placebo and tiotropium. These benefits were associated with improvements in other symptoms and reduced use of rescue medication. Efficacy of Tiotropium + Olodaterol in Patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease by Initial Disease Severity and Treatment Intensity: A Post Hoc Analysis.The once-daily long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) tiotropium and once-daily long-acting β2-agonist (LABA) olodaterol have been studied as a once-daily fixed-dose combination (FDC) in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Two large, 52-week, double-blind, parallel-group studies in patients with moderate-very severe COPD demonstrated that tiotropium + olodaterol significantly improved lung function and symptoms versus the monocomponents. This post hoc analysis determined effects on lung function by prior LAMA or LABA maintenance treatment and initial disease severity.5162 patients were randomized and treated with olodaterol 5 µg, tiotropium 2.5 µg, tiotropium 5 µg, tiotropium + olodaterol 2.5/5 µg, or tiotropium + olodaterol 5/5 µg (all once daily via Respimat(®) inhaler). Primary efficacy (lung-function) end points were forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) area under the curve from 0 to 3 h (AUC0-3) and trough FEV1 responses (i.e., change from baseline). Pooled data are presented for the following subgroups: prior maintenance treatment with LAMA or LABA, Global initiative for chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) 2 (predicted FEV1 50% to <80%) and 3 (30% to <50%)/4 (<30%), sex, age, and prior use of inhaled corticosteroids.Tiotropium + olodaterol FDC improved lung function over the monocomponents in patients with GOLD 2 and 3-4 disease, irrespective of prior LAMA or LABA maintenance therapy; most comparisons between FDCs and their respective monocomponents were statistically significant (P < 0.05). FEV1 AUC0-3 and trough FEV1 responses for the individual treatments were generally greater in patients with less severe COPD at baseline.Tiotropium + olodaterol 5/5 µg significantly improved FEV1 AUC0-3 and trough FEV1 in all GOLD severity groups compared to olodaterol 5 µg and tiotropium 5 µg alone, irrespective of whether patients had received prior LAMA or LABA maintenance treatment. Improvements from baseline in lung function were generally greater in patients with less severe disease.Boehringer Ingelheim.ClinicalTrials.gov numbers, NCT01431274 and NCT01431287.28-Day safety and tolerability of umeclidinium in combination with vilanterol in COPD: a randomized placebo-controlled trial.Umeclidinium (UMEC; GSK573719) is a new long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) currently in development in combination with vilanterol (VI), an inhaled, long-acting beta₂ agonist for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The primary aim of this study was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of repeat dosing of UMEC and VI in combination once daily for 28 days in patients with COPD.This was a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study. Patients aged ≥40 years with post-bronchodilator FEV₁ ≤80% of predicted normal values and FEV₁/FVC ratio ≤0.70, and a smoking history of ≥10 pack-years, were randomized 4:1 to once-daily UMEC/VI (500/25 mcg; n = 42) or placebo (n = 9).UMEC/VI was non-inferior to placebo in weighted mean pulse rate over 0-6 h at Day 28 (primary endpoint: difference of -0.5 bpm, 95% CI: -5.5 to 4.5). There was no evidence of a difference between UMEC/VI compared with placebo in blood pressure, minimum and maximum pulse rate, or QTcF assessments. Adverse events (AEs) were reported by 11 (26%) patients in the UMEC/VI group and one (11%) patient in the placebo group. No serious AEs were reported. Both UMEC and VI showed rapid absorption (median t(max) ∼6 min for both drugs) with no evidence of accumulation for AUC or C(max) on Day 28 compared with Day 1 for UMEC or VI. There was no correlation between individual steady-state C(max) and pulse rate on Day 28. Change from baseline in trough FEV₁ on Day 29 showed numerically greater improvements with UMEC/VI compared with placebo.Once-daily dosing with UMEC in combination with VI in patients with moderate-to-very-severe COPD was well tolerated over 28 days.Efficacy and safety of coadministration of once-daily indacaterol and glycopyrronium versus indacaterol alone in COPD patients: the GLOW6 study.Addition of a second bronchodilator from a different pharmacological class may benefit patients with moderate-to-severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) whose symptoms are insufficiently controlled by bronchodilator monotherapy. GLOW6 evaluated the efficacy and safety of once-daily coadministration of the long-acting β2-agonist indacaterol (IND) and the long-acting muscarinic antagonist glycopyrronium (GLY) versus IND alone in patients with moderate-to-severe COPD.In this randomized, double-blind, parallel group, placebo-controlled, 12-week study, patients were randomized 1:1 to IND 150 μg and GLY 50 μg daily (IND + GLY) or IND 150 μg daily and placebo (IND + PBO) (all delivered via separate Breezhaler® devices). The primary objective was to demonstrate the superiority of IND + GLY versus IND + PBO for trough forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) at week 12. Other end points included trough FEV1 at day 1, FEV1 area under the curve from 30 minutes to 4 hours (AUC30min-4h), peak FEV1, inspiratory capacity and trough forced vital capacity (FVC) at day 1 and week 12, and transition dyspnea index (TDI) focal score, COPD symptoms, and rescue medication use over 12 weeks.A total of 449 patients were randomized (IND + GLY, 226; IND + PBO, 223); 94% completed the study. On day 1 and at week 12, IND + GLY significantly improved trough FEV1 versus IND + PBO, with treatment differences of 74 mL (95% CI 46-101 mL) and 64 mL (95% CI 28-99 mL), respectively (both P<0.001). IND + GLY significantly improved postdose peak FEV1, FEV1 AUC30min-4h, and trough FVC at day 1 and week 12 versus IND + PBO (all P<0.01). TDI focal score and COPD symptoms (percentage of days able to perform usual daily activities and change from baseline in mean daytime respiratory score) were significantly improved with IND + GLY versus IND + PBO (P<0.05). The incidence of adverse events was similar for the two treatment groups.In patients with moderate-to-severe COPD, once-daily coadministration of IND and GLY provides significant and sustained improvement in bronchodilation versus IND alone from day 1, with significant improvements in patient-centered outcomes.FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT2: Efficacy and Safety of QVA149 (Indacaterol/Glycopyrrolate) versus Its Monocomponents and Placebo in Patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease.Current Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) strategy recommends the combination of two long-acting bronchodilators of different pharmacologic classes for the management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) if symptoms are not adequately controlled by a single bronchodilator.The FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT2 studies evaluated the efficacy and safety of QVA149 (indacaterol/glycopyrrolate), a fixed-dose combination of a long-acting β2-agonist (indacaterol) and a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (glycopyrrolate), compared with its monocomponents and placebo in patients with moderate-to-severe COPD.FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT2 were 12-week, identical, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo- and active-controlled studies. Patients were randomized (1:1:1:1) to indacaterol/glycopyrrolate (27.5/15.6 μg twice daily), indacaterol (27.5 μg twice daily), glycopyrrolate (15.6 μg twice daily), or placebo, all delivered via the Neohaler device. The primary objective was to demonstrate the superiority of indacaterol/glycopyrrolate versus its monocomponents for standardized area under the curve from 0-12 hours for FEV1 at Week 12. Secondary objectives included St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire total score and transition dyspnea index total score and reduction in daily rescue medication use with indacaterol/glycopyrrolate versus placebo.In total, 2,038 patients were included in the pooled analysis. Indacaterol/glycopyrrolate was statistically superior in terms of FEV1 area under the curve from 0-12 hours compared with its monocomponents (P < 0.001). Statistically and clinically meaningful improvements in St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire total score, transition dyspnea index total score, and reduction in rescue medication use were observed with indacaterol/glycopyrrolate compared with placebo (P < 0.001). The safety profile was comparable across the treatment groups.Indacaterol/glycopyrrolate twice daily can be an alternative treatment option for the management of symptomatic patients with moderate-to-severe COPD. Clinical trial registered with www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT 01727141 and NCT 0171251).Magnitude of umeclidinium/vilanterol lung function effect depends on monotherapy responses: Results from two randomised controlled trials.Dual therapy with bronchodilators of different pharmacological classes may produce greater lung function improvements than either drug alone. However, the relationship between a patient's response to monotherapy and response to dual bronchodilator therapy is currently unknown. We aimed to investigate whether dual therapy with umeclidinium/vilanterol provides additional benefit over umeclidinium or vilanterol monotherapy in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) identified as responsive (increase from baseline in forced expiratory volume in 1s [FEV1] of ≥ 12% and ≥ 200 mL, Day 1) or non-responsive to monotherapy.In two randomised, double-blind, three-way complete-block, cross-over studies (DB2116132 n = 207; DB2116133 n = 182; intent-to-treat), all patients (moderate-to-very severe COPD) were randomised to 1 of 6 sequences and received once-daily umeclidinium 62.5 mcg, vilanterol 25 mcg, and umeclidinium/vilanterol 62.5/25 mcg (one treatment/14-day period; 10-14-day washout). Key endpoints were 0-6 h weighted mean FEV1 (Day 14) and trough FEV1 (Day 15). Adverse events, vital signs and COPD exacerbations were assessed. Pooled data are presented.Umeclidinium/vilanterol significantly (p ≤ 0.001, unless stated otherwise) increased 0-6 h weighted mean FEV1 versus umeclidinium in umeclidinium-responders (+114 mL), versus vilanterol in vilanterol-responders (+92 mL) and versus umeclidinium (+70 mL) and vilanterol (+62 mL) in non-responders. Improvements in trough FEV1 occurred with umeclidinium/vilanterol versus umeclidinium in umeclidinium-responders (+77 mL), versus vilanterol in vilanterol-responders (+86 mL), and versus umeclidinium (+42 mL [p = 0.020]) and vilanterol (+58 mL) in non-responders. All treatments were well tolerated.Once-daily umeclidinium/vilanterol significantly improved lung function in patients with COPD, with quantitatively greater improvements in patients identified as responders to umeclidinium and vilanterol monotherapy than non-responders.Comparison of tiotropium once daily, formoterol twice daily and both combined once daily in patients with COPD.This study compared the bronchodilator effects of tiotropium, formoterol and both combined in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). A total of 71 COPD patients (mean forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) 37% predicted) participated in a randomised, double-blind, three-way, crossover study and received tiotropium 18 microg q.d., formoterol 12 microg b.i.d. or both combined q.d. for three 6-week periods. The end-points were 24-h spirometry (FEV1, forced vital capacity (FVC)) at the end of each treatment, rescue salbutamol and safety. Compared with baseline (FEV1 prior to the first dose in the first period), tiotropium produced a significantly greater improvement in average daytime FEV1 (0-12 h) than formoterol (127 versus 86 mL), while average night-time FEV1 (12-24 h) was not different (tiotropium 43 mL, formoterol 38 mL). The most pronounced effects were provided by combination therapy (daytime 234 mL, night-time 86 mL); both differed significantly from single-agent therapies. Changes in FVC mirrored the FEV1 results. Compared with both single agents, daytime salbutamol use was significantly lower during combination therapy (tiotropium plus formoterol 1.81 puffs.day(-1), tiotropium 2.41 puffs x day(-1), formoterol 2.37 puffs x day(-1)). All treatments were well tolerated. In conclusion, in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients, tiotropium q.d. achieved a greater improvement in daytime and comparable improvement in night-time lung function compared with formoterol b.i.d. A combination of both drugs q.d. was most effective and provided an additive effect throughout the 24-h dosing interval.Effect of formoterol, tiotropium, and their combination in patients with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a pilot study.The aim of our study was to evaluate the pharmacodynamic effects of 1-day treatment with formoterol, tiotropium and their combination in patients with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD). Twenty-one (19 males, mean age 72+/-8 years, mean FEV1 38+/-14% of predicted values) patients with mild to moderate AECOPD were enrolled. Patients received formoterol (12 microg deliver via Modulite b.i.d.), tiotropium (18 microg dry powder capsules delivered via HandiHaler once daily), and their combination, in randomized sequence. Serial measurements of FEV1, FVC, IC, SpO2 and HR were performed over 24h. Formoterol, tiotropium, and their combination significantly improved the area under curves (AUCs) for FEV1, FVC and IC over 12 and 24h. The mean FEV1, FVC and IC AUC(0-12h) and AUC(0-24h) after formoterol and tiotropium combination were significantly higher than formoterol and tiotropium alone, whereas the differences between the two single drugs were not statistically significant. Formoterol, either alone or in combination with tiotropium, elicited a significantly faster onset of action, and combination elicited a greater maximum bronchodilation than both single drugs in terms of FEV1 and FVC. After 24h the bronchodilating effect of the three treatments disappeared, with the exception of the combination on FEV1. The results of this study have documented that, although the time course of the effects of evaluated drugs differs significantly from that in stable COPD, with a shorter bronchodilation both for tiotropium and formoterol, these two long-acting bronchodilators appear to also be complementary in mild to moderate AECOPD.Safety and tolerability of once-daily umeclidinium/vilanterol 125/25 mcg and umeclidinium 125 mcg in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: results from a 52-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.The long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) umeclidinium (UMEC) and the combination of UMEC with the long-acting β2-agonist (LABA) vilanterol (UMEC/VI) are approved maintenance treatments for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in the US and EU. They are not indicated for the treatment of asthma.In this 52-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group safety study (GSK study DB2113359; NCT01316887), patients were randomized 2:2:1 to UMEC/VI 125/25 mcg, UMEC 125 mcg, or placebo. Study endpoints included adverse events (AEs), clinical chemistry and hematology parameters, vital signs, 12-lead, and 24-hour Holter electrocardiograms. COPD exacerbations and rescue medication use were assessed as safety parameters; lung function was also evaluated.The incidence of on-treatment AEs, serious AEs (SAEs), and drug-related AEs was similar between treatment groups (AEs: 52-58%; SAEs: 6-7%; drug-related AEs: 12-13%). Headache was the most common AE in each treatment group (8-11%). AEs associated with the LAMA and LABA pharmacologic classes occurred at a low incidence across treatment groups. No clinically meaningful effects on vital signs or laboratory assessments were reported for active treatments versus placebo. The incidences of atrial arrhythmias with UMEC/VI 125/25 mcg were similar to placebo; for UMEC 125 mcg, the incidences of ectopic supraventricular beats, sustained supraventricular tachycardia, and ectopic supraventricular rhythm were ≥2% greater than placebo. With active treatments, COPD exacerbations were fewer (13-15% of patients reporting ≥1 exacerbation) and on average less rescue medication was required (1.6-2.2 puffs/day) versus placebo (24% reporting ≥1 exacerbation, 2.6 puffs/day). Both active treatments improved lung function versus placebo.UMEC/VI 125/25 mcg and UMEC 125 mcg were well tolerated over 12 months in patients with COPD.Tiotropium + olodaterol shows clinically meaningful improvements in quality of life.Tiotropium + olodaterol improves lung function and symptoms compared to monotherapies in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The OTEMTO 1 and 2 studies investigated the effects of tiotropium + olodaterol on lung function and health-related quality of life compared to placebo in patients with moderate to severe COPD.In these two replicate, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled trials, patients were randomised to receive tiotropium + olodaterol 5/5 μg, 2.5/5 μg, tiotropium 5 μg or placebo for 12 weeks, via the Respimat(®) inhaler. Primary end points were St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) total score, forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) area under the curve from 0 to 3 h (AUC0-3) response and trough FEV1 response.In OTEMTO 1 and 2, tiotropium + olodaterol 5/5 μg improved SGRQ total score by 4.89 (95% confidence interval [CI] -6.90, -2.88) and 4.56 (95% CI -6.50, -2.63) units versus placebo (both p < 0.0001), and 2.49 (95% CI -4.47, -0.51; p < 0.05) and 1.72 (95% CI -3.63, 0.19) units versus tiotropium 5 μg. Tiotropium + olodaterol 2.5/5 μg significantly improved SGRQ score compared to placebo. Both doses significantly improved FEV1 AUC0-3 response compared to placebo and tiotropium 5 μg. Tiotropium + olodaterol 5/5 and 2.5/5 μg also significantly improved trough FEV1 response compared to placebo (both studies) and separated from tiotropium 5 μg in OTEMTO 2. Adverse-event incidence was similar between treatment groups.Tiotropium + olodaterol improved lung function and quality of life compared to placebo and tiotropium 5 μg.ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01964352 and NCT02006732.Efficacy and safety of once-daily umeclidinium/vilanterol 62.5/25 mcg in COPD.To examine the efficacy and safety of the once-daily, inhaled, long-acting muscarinic antagonist/β2-agonist combination umeclidinium/vilanterol (UMEC/VI) compared with UMEC and VI monotherapies in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).In this 24-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01313650) eligible patients were randomised 3:3:3:2 to treatment with UMEC/VI 62.5/25 mcg, UMEC 62.5 mcg, VI 25 mcg or placebo administered once daily via dry powder inhaler (N = 1532; intent-to-treat population). Primary endpoint was trough forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) on Day 169 (23-24 h post-dose). Additional lung-function, symptomatic, and health-related quality-of-life endpoints were assessed, including 0-6 h weighted-mean FEV1, rescue salbutamol use, Transition Dyspnoea Index (TDI), Shortness Of Breath With Daily Activity (SOBDA) and St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) scores. Safety evaluations included adverse events (AEs), vital signs, 12-lead/24-h Holter electrocardiography parameters and clinical laboratory/haematology measurements.All active treatments produced statistically significant improvements in trough FEV1 compared with placebo on Day 169 (0.072-0.167 L, all p < 0.001); increases with UMEC/VI 62.5/25 mcg were significantly greater than monotherapies (0.052-0.095 L, p ≤ 0.004). Improvements were observed for UMEC/VI 62.5/25 mcg vs placebo for weighted-mean FEV1 on Day 168 (0.242 L, p < 0.001), rescue salbutamol use during Weeks 1-24 (-0.8 puffs/day, p = 0.001), TDI (1.2 units, p < 0.001), SOBDA (-0.17 units, p < 0.001) and SGRQ (-5.51 units, p < 0.001) scores. No clinically-significant changes in vital signs, electrocardiography, or laboratory parameters were observed.Once-daily UMEC/VI 62.5/25 mcg was well tolerated and provided clinically-significant improvements in lung function and symptoms in patients with COPD.The 24-h lung-function profile of once-daily tiotropium and olodaterol fixed-dose combination in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.This study investigated the effects on 24-h lung function and lung volume of a once-daily fixed-dose combination (FDC) of the long-acting muscarinic antagonist tiotropium and the long-acting β2-agonist olodaterol in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.This was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase III trial with an incomplete crossover design. Patients received four of the following six treatment options for 6 weeks each: placebo, olodaterol 5 μg, tiotropium 2.5 μg, tiotropium 5 μg, tiotropium + olodaterol FDC 2.5/5 μg and tiotropium + olodaterol FDC 5/5 μg, all delivered via the Respimat(®) inhaler. The primary end point was forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) area under the curve from 0 to 24 h (AUC0-24) response after 6 weeks of treatment; key secondary end points were FEV1 AUC from 0 to 12 h and AUC from 12 to 24 h, and further end points included lung-volume parameters measured using body plethysmography (subset of patients), measures of peak and trough FEV1, and incidence of adverse events.A significant improvement in FEV1 AUC0-24 response was observed with tiotropium + olodaterol 5/5 μg and 2.5/5 μg versus placebo and monotherapies after 6 weeks of treatment; mean response with tiotropium + olodaterol 5/5 μg versus placebo was 0.280 L (p < 0.0001). Differences to monotherapies with tiotropium + olodaterol 5/5 μg were 0.115 L versus olodaterol 5 μg, 0.127 L versus tiotropium 2.5 μg and 0.110 L versus tiotropium 5 μg (p < 0.0001 for all comparisons). Secondary end points supported these data. No safety concerns were identified.Overall, this study demonstrated improvements in lung function over 24 h with an FDC of tiotropium + olodaterol over tiotropium or olodaterol alone, with no observed difference in tolerability. ClinicalTrials.gov number: NCT01559116.Long-term general and cardiovascular safety of tiotropium/olodaterol in patients with moderate to very severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.Long-term safety, particularly cardiovascular safety, is of special interest in maintenance treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with long-acting βTwo 52-week Phase III trials (TONADOThis analysis comprised 3100 patients with moderate to very severe COPD, treated for ≤1 year, including 784 patients with cardiovascular co-morbidities. AEs were balanced across treatments in the total population as well as in patient subgroups with pre-existing cardiovascular co-morbidities. The incidence and nature of events were consistent with the disease under study and a 1-year trial duration. 494/3100 patients contributed to an adjudicated analysis of SAEs: 260 had respiratory-related, 53 had cardiovascular-related and 16 had cerebrovascular-related SAEs. Incidences of these SAEs were comparable between treatments. There was no evidence of any increased risk for the combination compared to the monotherapy groups.These data provide confidence for clinicians that tiotropium/olodaterol 5/5 μg can be safely administered once-daily to patients with moderate to very severe COPD long-term, including those with significant cardiovascular co-morbidity.ClinicalTrials.gov, Nos.: NCT01431274, NCT01431287.Pooled safety analysis of the fixed-dose combination of indacaterol and glycopyrronium (QVA149), its monocomponents, and tiotropium versus placebo in COPD patients.To further assess the safety profile of the fixed-dose combination of indacaterol and glycopyrronium (QVA149) and its monocomponents; we investigated the impact of individual patient-level factors and time by integrating the patient-level safety data from the QVA149 clinical programme with relevant information from the independent indacaterol and glycopyrronium safety databases.Data from 11,404 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) were pooled from 14 clinical studies of QVA149, indacaterol and glycopyrronium of ≥3 month's duration with at least two of the treatment groups: QVA149 110/50 μg, glycopyrronium 50 μg, indacaterol 150 μg, placebo or tiotropium 18 μg. Overall hazard ratio (HR) was assessed between the active treatments and placebo and in various subgroups related to severity of airways obstruction, inhaled corticosteroid use, cardiovascular risk factors, sex, age and body mass index for death, serious cases of cardio- and cerebrovascular (CCV) events, major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs), pneumonia, COPD exacerbations requiring hospitalisation or atrial flutter/fibrillation (AF/F).The HR for QVA149 versus placebo showed no significant increase in the overall risk for death (HR [95% confidence interval]: 0.93 [0.34-2.54]); CCV events (0.60 [0.29-1.24]); MACE (1.04 [0.45-2.42]); pneumonia (1.10 [0.54-2.25]); COPD exacerbations (0.60 [0.40-0.91]); and AF/F (1.03 [0.49-2.18]). Similar results were observed for indacaterol, glycopyrronium and tiotropium versus placebo for overall risk and in analysed subgroups.There was no increase in the risk for the investigated safety endpoints for the fixed-dose combination QVA149, and it had a comparable safety profile as its monocomponents and tiotropium versus placebo.Effects of combined tiotropium/olodaterol on inspiratory capacity and exercise endurance in COPD.Two replicate, double-blind, 6-week, incomplete-crossover studies (MORACTO 1 and 2) assessed the effects of tiotropium/olodaterol on inspiratory capacity and exercise endurance time in patients with moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.For each patient, four of five treatments were administered once daily for 6 weeks, with a 21-day washout between treatments: tiotropium/olodaterol 2.5/5 µg or 5/5 µg, tiotropium 5 µg, olodaterol 5 µg or placebo, all Prevention of clinically important deteriorations in COPD with umeclidinium/vilanterol.Minimizing the risk of disease progression and exacerbations is the key goal of COPD management, as these are well-established indicators of poor COPD prognosis. We developed a novel composite end point assessing three important aspects (lung function, health status, and exacerbations) of worsening in COPD. The objective was to determine whether dual bronchodilation with umeclidinium/vilanterol (UMEC/VI) reduces clinically important deteriorations (CIDs) in COPD versus placebo or bronchodilator monotherapy.This study is a post hoc analysis of two 24-week trials comparing UMEC/VI 62.5/25 µg with UMEC 62.5 µg, VI 25 µg, or placebo (Study A; NCT01313650), or UMEC/VI 62.5/25 µg with tiotropium (TIO) 18 µg (Study B; NCT01777334) in patients with symptomatic COPD, without a history of frequent exacerbations. Deterioration was assessed as the time to a first CID, a composite measure defined as a decrease of ≥100 mL in trough forced expiratory volume in 1 second or ≥4-unit increase in St George's Respiratory Questionnaire total score or an on-treatment moderate-to-severe COPD exacerbation.In Study A, fewer patients experienced a first CID with UMEC/VI (44%) versus UMEC (50%), VI (56%), and placebo (75%). The risk of a first CID was reduced with UMEC/VI (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.37 [95% confidence interval, CI: 0.30, 0.45]), UMEC (HR: 0.46 [95% CI: 0.38, 0.56]), and VI (HR: 0.55 [95% CI: 0.45, 0.66]; all P<0.001) versus placebo, and with UMEC/VI versus UMEC (HR: 0.80 [95% CI: 0.65, 0.97]; P<0.05) and versus VI (HR: 0.67 [95% CI: 0.55, 0.81]; P<0.001). In Study B, fewer patients experienced a first CID with UMEC/VI (41%) versus TIO (59%). UMEC/VI reduced the risk of a first composite CID by 43% versus TIO (HR: 0.57 [95% CI: 0.47, 0.69]; P<0.001).This exploratory analysis, using a new assessment of clinical deterioration in COPD, revealed that a majority of symptomatic patients with low exacerbation risk experienced a deterioration during the 24-week study periods. UMEC/VI reduces the risk of a first CID versus placebo or bronchodilator monotherapy.Effects of tiotropium + olodaterol versus tiotropium or placebo by COPD disease severity and previous treatment history in the OTEMTO® studies.As lung function declines rapidly in the early stages of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), the effects of bronchodilators in patients with moderate disease and those who have not previously received maintenance therapy are of interest. OTEMTO® 1 and 2 were two replicate, 12-week, Phase III studies investigating the benefit of tiotropium + olodaterol on lung function and quality of life in patients with moderate to severe disease. Post hoc analyses were performed to assess the benefits for patients according to disease severity and treatment history.Four subgroup analyses were performed: Global initiative for chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) 2/3, GOLD A/B/C/D, treatment naive/not treatment naive and receiving inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) at baseline/not receiving ICS at baseline. Primary end points were change in forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) area under the curve from 0 to 3 h response, change in trough FEV1 and St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) total score. Transition Dyspnoea Index (TDI) focal score was a secondary end point, and SGRQ and TDI responder analyses were further end points; all were assessed at 12 weeks.In all subgroups, patients receiving tiotropium + olodaterol responded better overall than those receiving tiotropium monotherapy. Improvements with tiotropium + olodaterol over placebo or tiotropium monotherapy were noted across GOLD 2/3 and GOLD A/B/C/D; however, improvements in SGRQ total score were most evident in the GOLD B subgroup. Moreover, lung-function outcomes were generally greater in those patients who had been receiving previous long-acting bronchodilator and/or ICS maintenance treatment.These data suggest that tiotropium + olodaterol should be considered as a treatment option in patients with moderate COPD who are initiating maintenance therapy, as well as those with more severe disease.ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01964352 and NCT02006732 .Formoterol mono- and combination therapy with tiotropium in patients with COPD: a 6-month study.Although guidelines recommend combining long-acting bronchodilators in COPD, data are limited. We examined the clinical efficacy and safety of formoterol, tiotropium and the combination in patients with COPD. Eight hundred and forty-seven patients with COPD (mean FEV(1) 52% predicted; FEV(1)/FVC 53%) were randomized to receive one of the following four treatments for 24 weeks: formoterol 10 microg b.i.d. plus tiotropium 18 microg o.d.; formoterol 10 microg b.i.d.; tiotropium 18 microg o.d., or placebo. The study was partially blinded (formoterol and placebo). For the primary endpoint, FEV(1) 2h post-dose after 24 weeks, there were small differences in favour of the combination therapy versus formoterol (0.07 L, p=0.044) or tiotropium (0.06 L, p=0.066). All three treatments were superior to placebo (p<0.001). The combination was statistically superior to monotherapy for: the primary endpoint (p=0.044 vs. formoterol); FEV(1) 5 min after the first dose (p<0.001) and at 12 weeks (p<0.05 vs. tiotropium); and peak expiratory flow averaged over the first 6 weeks (p<0.001 vs. both). The three active treatments were significantly more effective than placebo for secondary endpoints: COPD-related 'bad days', symptoms, use of rescue medication and peak expiratory flow, and aspects of health-related quality of life. The overall incidence of adverse events was similar with all active treatments, although COPD-related adverse events were more common with tiotropium. Combined bronchodilator therapy may be a valuable treatment option for patients with COPD.Computed tomography assessment of airway dimensions with combined tiotropium and indacaterol therapy in COPD patients.Combining a long-acting muscarinic antagonist with a long-acting β₂-agonist has been shown to be pharmacologically useful in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the dual bronchodilator therapy on airway dimensions in COPD.Patients (n = 54) were randomly assigned to receive tiotropium (18 μg once daily), indacaterol (150 μg once daily) or tiotropium plus indacaterol for 16 weeks. Quantitative computed tomography (CT), pulmonary function and health status (St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire) were measured.Compared with tiotropium or indacaterol alone, combination therapy resulted in a significant decrease in percentage wall area (WA%) and wall thickness, corrected for body surface area, and an increase in luminal area (Ai/BSA). Concurrent treatment was superior to monotherapy in physiological indices, including forced vital capacity, forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV₁) and inspiratory capacity. The changes in WA% and Ai/BSA were significantly correlated with changes in FEV₁ (r = -0.44, P < 0.01 and r = 0.37, P < 0.01). There were more significant improvements in SGRQ scores after treatment with combined therapy than with either treatment alone.Concurrent therapy with tiotropium and indacaterol is effective for COPD patients to promote reduction in airway wall thickness, bronchodilation, and improvements in lung function compared with a single inhaler.Efficacy and safety of once-daily inhaled umeclidinium/vilanterol in Asian patients with COPD: results from a randomized, placebo-controlled study.Combination of the inhaled long-acting muscarinic antagonist umeclidinium (UMEC; GSK573719) with the long-acting β2-agonist vilanterol (VI) is an approved maintenance treatment for COPD in the US and EU. We compared the efficacy and safety of UMEC/VI with placebo in patients with COPD of Asian ancestry.In this 24-week, Phase III, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study, patients were randomized 1:1:1 to UMEC/VI 125/25 μg, UMEC/VI 62.5/25 μg, or placebo. The primary efficacy end point was trough forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) on day 169; secondary end points were Transition Dyspnea Index (TDI) focal score at week 24 and weighted mean (WM) FEV1 over 0-6 hours postdose on day 1. Additional end points and safety were also assessed.Both UMEC/VI 125/25 μg and UMEC/VI 62.5/25 μg statistically significantly improved trough FEV1 at day 169 versus placebo (UMEC/VI 125/25 μg, 0.216 L, [95% confidence interval [CI] 0.175-0.257]; UMEC/VI 62.5/25 μg, 0.151 L, 95% CI 0.110-0.191; both P<0.001). Statistically significant improvements in TDI score were observed for both UMEC/VI groups versus placebo (UMEC/VI 125/25 μg, 0.9, 95% CI 0.3-1.4, P=0.002; UMEC/VI 62.5/25 μg, 0.7, 95% CI 0.1-1.2, P=0.016). On day 1, both UMEC/VI groups improved 0-6-hour WM FEV1 versus placebo (UMEC/VI 125/25 μg, 0.182 L 95% CI 0.161-0.203; UMEC/VI 62.5/25 μg, 0.160 L, 95% CI 0.139-0.181; both P<0.001). Statistically significant improvements for UMEC/VI groups versus placebo were observed for rescue albuterol use at weeks 1-24 (puffs/day, both P<0.001). The incidence of adverse events was similar across groups.In Asian patients with COPD, once-daily UMEC/VI 125/25 μg and UMEC 62.5/25 μg resulted in clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvements in lung-function end points versus placebo. Symptomatic and quality of life measures also improved. The safety profile of UMEC/VI was consistent with previous studies.Efficacy and safety of combining olodaterol Respimat(®) and tiotropium HandiHaler(®) in patients with COPD: results of two randomized, double-blind, active-controlled studies.Combining bronchodilators with different mechanisms of action may improve efficacy and reduce risk of side effects compared to increasing the dose of a single agent in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). We investigated this by combining two long-acting bronchodilators: once-daily muscarinic antagonist tiotropium and once-daily β2-agonist olodaterol.Two replicate, double-blind, randomized, 12-week studies (ANHELTO 1 [NCT01694771] and ANHELTO 2 [NCT01696058]) evaluated the efficacy and safety of olodaterol 5 μg once daily (via Respimat(®)) combined with tiotropium 18 μg once daily (via HandiHaler(®)) versus tiotropium 18 μg once daily (via HandiHaler(®)) combined with placebo (via Respimat(®)) in patients with moderate to severe COPD. Primary efficacy end points were area under the curve from 0-3 hours of forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1 AUC0-3) and trough FEV1 after 12 weeks (for the individual trials). A key secondary end point was health status by St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) total score (combined data set).Olodaterol + tiotropium resulted in significant improvements over tiotropium + placebo in FEV1 AUC0-3 (treatment differences: 0.117 L [P<0.001], ANHELTO 1; 0.106 L [P<0.001], ANHELTO 2) and trough FEV1 (treatment differences: 0.062 L [P<0.001], ANHELTO 1; 0.040 L [P=0.0029], ANHELTO 2); these were supported by secondary end points. These effects translated to improvements in SGRQ total scores (treatment difference -1.85; P<0.0001). The tolerability profile of olodaterol + tiotropium was similar to tiotropium monotherapy.These studies demonstrated that olodaterol (Respimat(®)) and tiotropium (HandiHaler(®)) provided bronchodilatory effects above tiotropium alone in patients with COPD. In general, both treatments were well tolerated.Long-term safety of aclidinium bromide/formoterol fumarate fixed-dose combination: Results of a randomized 1-year trial in patients with COPD.This was a one-year, Phase III randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, active-control study investigating the long-term safety and tolerability of twice-daily aclidinium 400 μg/formoterol 12 μg versus formoterol 12 μg.Eligible patients were male or female, current or ex-smokers (history of ≥10 pack-years) aged ≥40 years with a diagnosis of moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD): post-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1)/forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio <70%, and post-bronchodilator FEV1≥30% and <80% predicted. Patients were randomized 2:1 to twice-daily aclidinium 400 μg/formoterol 12 μg or formoterol 12 μg, administered via a multidose dry powder inhaler (Genuair™/Pressair(®))(1). The objective was to evaluate the one-year safety of aclidinium 400 μg/formoterol 12 μg versus formoterol 12 μg.All 590 patients were included in the safety population; 392 patients received aclidinium 400 μg/formoterol 12 μg and 198 patients received formoterol 12 μg. Of these, 581 patients were included in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population (385 patients received aclidinium 400 μg/formoterol 12 μg; 196 patients received formoterol 12 μg). In the safety population, the percentage of patients with ≥1 treatment-emergent adverse event was similar between aclidinium 400 μg/formoterol 12 μg (71.4%) and formoterol 12 μg (65.7%). Mean baseline post-bronchodilator FEV1 was 51.3% of predicted (ITT population). Aclidinium 400 μg/formoterol 12 μg significantly improved morning pre-dose (trough) FEV1 and trough FVC versus formoterol 12 μg at each assessment, with improvements at Week 1 (least squares mean difference [LSMD]: 87.4 mL and 157.8 mL, respectively) maintained at study end (LSMD: 81.5 mL and 185.4 mL, respectively).Aclidinium 400 μg/formoterol 12 μg was well tolerated, with a safety profile similar to formoterol 12 μg and consistent with that seen in two Phase III studies. Additionally, aclidinium 400 μg/formoterol 12 μg improved lung function versus formoterol 12 μg, with a sustained effect over one year.Effects of indacaterol/glycopyrronium (QVA149) on lung hyperinflation and physical activity in patients with moderate to severe COPD: a randomised, placebo-controlled, crossover study (The MOVE Study).Physical activity limitation is common in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and is associated with worse health status, and increased hospitalisation and mortality. Long-acting bronchodilators, either alone or in combination, have been shown to improve exercise intolerance. However, none of these studies were designed with physical activity as primary outcome. This study assessed the effect of indacaterol/glycopyrronium fixed dose combination (IND/GLY) 110/50 μg once daily (OD) versus placebo on lung hyperinflation (inspiratory capacity [IC]) and physical activity in patients with moderate-to-severe COPD.In this multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study, patients received IND/GLY or placebo OD in two 21-day treatment periods (14-day washout between periods). Eligible patients were ≥40 years of age, current or ex-smokers (smoking history ≥10 pack-years), with post-salbutamol forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) 40-80 % predicted, and FEV1:forced vital capacity <0.70. The co-primary endpoints were peak IC after 21 days and average daily activity-related energy expenditure. Key secondary endpoints were average number of steps per day and the duration of at least moderate activity per day. Peak IC and FEV1 on Day 1, and trough IC and FEV1 after 21 days were other secondary endpoints.A total of 194 patients were randomised (65.5 % male, mean age 62.8 years, mean FEV1 61.6 % predicted), with 183 (94.3 %) completing the study. Compared with placebo, IND/GLY significantly increased peak IC after 21 days (difference 202 mL, p < 0.0001), activity-related energy expenditure (difference 36.7 kcal/day, p = 0.040), and the average number of steps per day (difference 358, p = 0.029), with a trend towards an improvement in the duration of at least moderate activity (difference 4.4 min, p = 0.264). IND/GLY was associated with statistically significant improvements versus placebo in peak IC and FEV1 on Day 1, and trough IC and FEV1 after 21 days. The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events was 22.8 % with IND/GLY and 22.9 % with placebo.In this study, compared with placebo, IND/GLY reduced hyperinflation, and, despite no patient education or lifestyle advice, improved daily physical activity levels. This suggests that IND/GLY has the potential to impact two of the main clinical concerns in the care of patients with COPD.ClinicalTrials.gov number: NCT01996319 .QVA149 demonstrates superior bronchodilation compared with indacaterol or placebo in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.This randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled, four-period crossover study assessed the efficacy and safety of once-daily QVA149, a dual bronchodilator consisting of the long-acting β2-agonist indacaterol and the long-acting muscarinic antagonist glycopyrronium (NVA237), in patients with moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).Patients (N=154) were randomly assigned to receive QVA149 (indacaterol/NVA237) 300/50 μg, indacaterol 300 μg, indacaterol 600 μg, or placebo, once daily for 7 days with a 7-day washout period between each treatment. The primary endpoint was trough forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) (mean of 23 h 15 min and 23 h 45 min post-dose values) on day 7. Other endpoints included trough FEV1 on day 1, individual time point FEV1 and monitoring and recording of all adverse events.A total of 135 (87.7%) patients completed the study (all randomly assigned patients: mean age 61.7 years, 61.4% male, post-bronchodilator FEV1 52.2% predicted, FEV1/forced vital capacity 47.6%). The estimated treatment difference (95% CI) for trough FEV1 on day 7 between QVA149 and placebo was 226 ml (192 to 260; p<0.001). The estimated treatment difference between QVA149 and indacaterol 300 and 600 μg was 123 ml (89 to 157; p<0.001) and 117 ml (83 to 150; p<0.001), respectively. The improvements in mean trough FEV1 exceeded the predefined minimal clinically important differences of 100–140 ml for QVA149 versus placebo and indacaterol. Similar results were observed on day 1. All treatments were well tolerated.QVA149 demonstrated rapid and sustained bronchodilation with significant improvements compared with indacaterol monotherapy and placebo in patients with COPD.NCT00570778.ACTIVATE: the effect of aclidinium/formoterol on hyperinflation, exercise capacity, and physical activity in patients with COPD.The Phase IV, 8-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled ACTIVATE study (NCT02424344) evaluated the effect of aclidinium/formoterol (AB/FF) 400/12 μg twice daily on lung hyperinflation, exercise capacity, and physical activity in patients with moderate-to-severe COPD. Patients received AB/FF (n=134) or placebo (n=133) (1:1) via the Genuair™/PressairIndacaterol and glycopyrronium versus indacaterol on body plethysmography measurements in COPD-a randomised controlled study.Dual bronchodilator therapy is recommended for symptomatic patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). There are limited data on effects of a combination of two long-acting bronchodilators on lung function including body plethysmography.This multicentre, randomised, double-blind, single-dose, cross-over, placebo-controlled study evaluated efficacy and safety of the free combination of indacaterol maleate (IND) and glycopyrronium bromide (GLY) versus IND alone on spirometric and body plethysmography parameters, including inspiratory capacity (IC), forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEVSeventy-eight patients with FEVThe free combination of IND + GLY improved lung function parameters as evaluated by spirometry and body plethysmography, with a similar safety profile compared to IND alone.NCT01699685.Effects of tiotropium and formoterol on dynamic hyperinflation and exercise endurance in COPD.It is currently unclear whether the additive effects of a long-acting beta(2)-agonist (LABA) and the antimuscarinic tiotropium bromide (TIO) on resting lung function are translated into lower operating lung volumes and improved exercise tolerance in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).On a double-blind and cross-over study, 33 patients (FEV(1) = 47.4 +/- 12.9% predicted) were randomly allocated to 2-wk formoterol fumarate 12 microg twice-daily (FOR) plus TIO 18 microg once-daily or FOR plus placebo (PLA). Inspiratory capacity (IC) was obtained on constant-speed treadmill tests to the limit of tolerance (Tlim).FOR-TIO was superior to FOR-PLA in increasing post-treatment FEV(1) and Tlim (1.34 +/- 0.42 L vs. 1.25 +/- 0.39 L and 124 +/- 27% vs. 68 +/- 14%, respectively; p < 0.05). FOR-TIO slowed the rate of decrement in exercise IC compared to FOR-PLA (Deltaisotime-rest = -0.27 +/- 0.40 L vs. -0.45 +/- 0.36 L, p < 0.05). In addition, end-expiratory lung volume (% total lung capacity) was further reduced with FOR-TIO (p < 0.05). Of note, patients showing greater increases in Tlim with FOR-TIO (16/26, 61.6%) had more severe airways obstruction and lower exercise capacity at baseline. Improvement in Tlim with FOR-TIO was also related to larger increases in FEV(1) (p < 0.05).Compared to FOR monotherapy, FOR-TIO further improved effort-induced dynamic hyperinflation and exercise endurance in patients with moderate-to-severe COPD. These beneficial consequences were more likely to be found in severely-disabled patients with larger resting functional responses to the combination therapy.Clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00680056 [ClinicalTrials.gov].
