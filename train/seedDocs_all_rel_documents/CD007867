Immediate metabolic effects of different nutritional regimens in critically ill medical patients.Metabolic effects of different caloric regimens were investigated in nonsurgical, medical patients with multiple-organ failure (MOF).Seven total parenteral nutrition (TPN) regimens were administered, differing in amount (14, 28, and 56 kcal/kg per day, i.e., hypo-, iso-, and hypercaloric nutrition, respectively) and distribution [carbohydrates (COH), amino acids (AA), long-chain and medium-chain triglycerides (LCT/MCT)] of calories. Each regimen was administered over 12 h. Metabolism was monitored by energy expenditure (EE), body temperature (BT), protein breakdown (PB), and blood glucose and serum lactate levels. Measurements were started within 2 days of MOF onset.The study was conducted in a medical intensive care unit.Twenty patients with MOF on mechanical ventilation (mean Apache II score x = 26) were investigated.The mean values of the EE (x = 31 kcal/kg per day), BT (x = 38 degrees C), PB (x = 1.5 g/kg per day), and lactate (x = 2.0 mmol/l) and glucose level (x = 222 mg/dl) parameters were elevated. EE, BT, and lactate and glucose levels were significantly lower under hypocaloric nutrition than during iso- and hypercaloric nutrition (p < 0.01). Differences in the metabolic effects of LCT and MCT were not significant. PB was significantly elevated under hypercaloric nutrition (p < 0.01). Protein balance was positive under hypercaloric nutrition, and negative under iso- and hypocaloric nutrition.In nonsurgical, medical patients neither hypercaloric nor isocaloric nutritional support prevented protein catabolism; in contrast, they enhanced the metabolic burden measured by EE, thermogenesis, urea production rate, and glucose and lactate levels. A hypocaloric regimen is therefore recommended for these patients during the early phase of MOF.Hypocaloric total parenteral nutrition: effectiveness in prevention of hyperglycemia and infectious complications--a randomized clinical trial.To determine whether the frequency rate of hyperglycemia and infectious complications can be reduced by an underfeeding strategy in patients requiring total parenteral nutrition (TPN), without deleterious effects on nitrogen balance.Prospective, randomized, controlled nonblinded trial.A university-affiliated teaching hospital with a dedicated TPN service.TPN was initiated in 40 adult patients and continued for > or =5 days.Two different TPN feeding strategies were compared: hypocaloric feeding (1 L containing 70 g protein and 1000 kcal) and standard weight-based regimen, begun in similar amounts initially, but advanced in increments toward 25 kcal and 1.5 g protein/kg dry (or adjusted ideal) weight.We evaluated the frequency rate of hyperglycemia, average blood glucose, numbers and types of infections while receiving nutritional support and nitrogen balance after 5 days of TPN. There were significant differences between the quantities of calories, dextrose, fat, and protein provided to the two groups. However, average blood glucose, frequency rate of hyperglycemia, and infection rates (from intravenous catheter, pneumonia, and wound/abdominal collection) were similar in each group. The control group showed a trend toward a higher insulin requirement. Nitrogen balance, only available as a subset, was significantly more negative in the hypocaloric group.Provision of TPN to a goal of 25 kcal/kg was not associated with more hyperglycemia or infections than a deliberate underfeeding strategy. A regimen of 1.5 g/kg protein in conjunction with 25 kcal/kg did, however, provide significant nutritional benefit in terms of nitrogen balance in comparison with hypocaloric TPN.Whole body protein kinetics during hypocaloric and normocaloric feeding in critically ill patients.Optimal feeding of critically ill patients in the ICU is controversial. Existing guidelines rest on rather weak evidence. Whole body protein kinetics may be an attractive technique for assessing optimal protein intake. In this study, critically ill patients were investigated during hypocaloric and normocaloric IV nutrition.Neurosurgical patients on mechanical ventilation (n = 16) were studied during a 48-hour period. In random order 50% and 100% of measured energy expenditure was given as IV nutrition during 24 hours, corresponding to hypocaloric and normocaloric nutrition, respectively. At the end of each period, whole body protein turnover was measured using d5-phenylalanine and 13C-leucine tracers.The phenylalanine tracer indicated that whole-body protein synthesis was lower during hypocaloric feeding, while whole-body protein degradation and amino acid oxidation were unaltered, which resulted in a more negative protein balance, namely -1.9 ± 2.1 versus -0.7 ± 1.3 mg phenylalanine/kg/h (P = 0.014). The leucine tracer indicated that whole body protein synthesis and degradation and amino acid oxidation were unaltered, but the protein balance was negative during hypocaloric feeding, namely -0.3 ± 0.5 versus 0.6 ± 0.5 mg leucine/kg/h (P < 0.001).In the patient group studied, hypocaloric feeding was associated with a more negative protein balance, but the amino acid oxidation was not different. The protein kinetics measurements and the study's investigational protocol were useful for assessing the efficacy of nutrition support on protein metabolism in critically ill patients.Hypocaloric vs Normocaloric Nutrition in Critically Ill Patients: A Prospective Randomized Pilot Trial.Optimal nutrition of critically ill patients is still a matter of debate. This pilot trial aimed to compare the impact of normocaloric vs hypocaloric feeding in critically ill patients in the first 7 days in the intensive care unit (ICU). The primary end point was the rate of nosocomial infections during the ICU stay.Critically ill patients requiring artificial nutrition for at least 72 hours were included within 24 hours of ICU admission and randomized into a normocaloric group (receiving 100% of their daily energy expenditure) and a hypocaloric group (receiving 50% of their daily energy expenditure).One hundred patients were included (54 in the normocaloric group and 46 in the hypocaloric group). There were 66 male and 34 female patients with a mean age of 65.8 ± 11.6 years. The mean daily caloric supply was 19.7 ± 5.7 kcal/kg for the normocaloric group and 11.3 ± 3.1 kcal/kg for the hypocaloric group (P = .0001). Insulin demand was significantly higher and gastrointestinal intolerance more frequent in the normocaloric group than in the hypocaloric group. Nosocomial infections were detected more frequently in the hypocaloric group than in the normocaloric group (26.1% vs 11.1%, respectively). The ICU mortality rate was 22.2% in the normocaloric group and 21.7% in the hypocaloric group (not significant). The hospital mortality rate was 31.5% in the normocaloric group and 37.0% in the hypocaloric group (P = .67).Hypocaloric feeding in the first 7 days in critically ill patients was associated with more nosocomial infections but less insulin demand and less gastrointestinal intolerance compared with normocaloric feeding.DRKS00000104 (German Clinical Trials Register).Influence of parenteral nutrition on leg nitrogen exchange in injured patients.Body N balance, 3-methylhistidine (MEH) excretion, amino acid (AA) plasma concentration, and fluxes across the leg were investigated both during fasting and during parenteral nutrition of injured patients in order to better understand protein-sparing mechanisms induced by metabolic support in the whole body and in skeletal muscle. Patients were randomized to receive 15 or 30 kcal/kg.day coupled with 0.30 g of N either with standard or branch-chain (BC)-enriched AA solutions. During fasting, patients were highly catabolic (N balance -14.7 +/- 1.2 g N/m2.day, MEH excretion 422 +/- 25 mumol/m2.day) and showed a high efflux of AA N from the leg (5.08 +/- 2.1 g N/m2.day) without difference between the groups. During treatment, body N balance (-5.55 +/- 0.88, p less than .001) and MEH excretion (284 +/- 20, p less than .001) were significantly reduced without difference among the groups; also, AA N leg efflux (2.64 +/- 0.47, p less than .001) was reduced. Moreover, considering the effect of calorie load, patients receiving 30 kcal/kg.day showed a lower efflux of total AA N and of some AA considered as markers of muscle protein catabolism, such as phe, lys, met, and glu. The main difference between solutions was in the efflux of BCAA; particularly, val and leu efflux was turned into uptake in the BCAA group. No significant difference among the groups was found in N balance and MEH excretion during treatment. In brief, muscle catabolism was reduced in an amount dependent on glucose and insulin load, but it was not influenced by BCAA supply. Whole body net protein catabolism was reduced through different mechanisms, either an increased visceral N retention or a decreased muscle N loss. However, muscle N loss was never abolished even in the high calorie groups.Early hypocaloric enteral nutritional supplementation in acute organophosphate poisoning--a prospective randomized trial.Early institution of enteral feeds may be associated with improved outcomes in the critically ill. This study evaluated the effect of hypocaloric enteral nutritional supplementation in acute organophosphate(OP)-poisoned patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation.Prospective randomized controlled trial conducted in the medical intensive care unit (ICU) of a tertiary care university teaching hospital.During a 13-month period, 87 OP-poisoned patients were admitted. Twenty-seven patients who were not ventilated were excluded. Thirty patients were randomized to the control arm and 29 to the intervention arm. The intervention arm received hypocaloric nasogastric feeds within 48 h of intubation whilst the control arm received intravenous fluids. Primary outcome was infectious complications. Secondary outcomes included hospital mortality, duration of ventilation, ICU stay, and hospital stay.An infectious complication occurred in 14 patients (48%) in the intervention group and 15 patients (50%) in the control group (p = 0.898). Three patients in each group died (p = 0.965). Duration of ventilation (p = 0.19) and ICU stay (p = 0.41) were similar. Duration of hospital stay was shorter in the control group (p = 0.05). Gastric stasis occurred in two patients (6.9%) receiving enteral feeds. Feeding related complications were less frequent than in other published trials.In OP-poisoned patients, early hypocaloric enteral feeding was not associated with improvements in clinical endpoints, albeit longer hospital stay was observed in the enterally fed group. Feeding related complications were infrequent. Further studies would help define the status of early enteral feeding in this subset of patients.Hypocaloric compared with eucaloric nutritional support and its effect on infection rates in a surgical intensive care unit: a randomized controlled trial.Proper caloric intake goals in critically ill surgical patients are unclear. It is possible that overnutrition can lead to hyperglycemia and an increased risk of infection.This study was conducted to determine whether surgical infection outcomes in the intensive care unit (ICU) could be improved with the use of hypocaloric nutritional support.Eighty-three critically ill patients were randomly allocated to receive either the standard calculated daily caloric requirement of 25-30 kcal · kg(-1) · d(-1) (eucaloric) or 50% of that value (hypocaloric) via enteral tube feeds or parenteral nutrition, with an equal protein allocation in each group (1.5 g · kg(-1) · d(-1)).There were 82 infections in the hypocaloric group and 66 in the eucaloric group, with no significant difference in the mean (± SE) number of infections per patient (2.0 ± 0.6 and 1.6 ± 0.2, respectively; P = 0.50), percentage of patients acquiring infection [70.7% (29 of 41) and 76.2% (32 of 42), respectively; P = 0.57], mean ICU length of stay (16.7 ± 2.7 and 13.5 ± 1.1 d, respectively; P = 0.28), mean hospital length of stay (35.2 ± 4.9 and 31.0 ± 2.5 d, respectively; P = 0.45), mean 0600 glucose concentration (132 ± 2.9 and 135 ± 3.1 mg/dL, respectively; P = 0.63), or number of mortalities [3 (7.3%) and 4 (9.5%), respectively; P = 0.72]. Further analyses revealed no differences when analyzed by sex, admission diagnosis, site of infection, or causative organism.Among critically ill surgical patients, caloric provision across a wide acceptable range does not appear to be associated with major outcomes, including infectious complications. The optimum target for caloric provision remains elusive.Early parenteral nutrition in critically ill patients with short-term relative contraindications to early enteral nutrition: a randomized controlled trial.Systematic reviews suggest adult patients in intensive care units (ICUs) with relative contraindications to early enteral nutrition (EN) may benefit from parenteral nutrition (PN) provided within 24 hours of ICU admission.To determine whether providing early PN to critically ill adults with relative contraindications to early EN alters outcomes.Multicenter, randomized, single-blind clinical trial conducted between October 2006 and June 2011 in ICUs of 31 community and tertiary hospitals in Australia and New Zealand. Participants were critically ill adults with relative contraindications to early EN who were expected to remain in the ICU longer than 2 days.Random allocation to pragmatic standard care or early PN.Day-60 mortality; quality of life, infections, and body composition.A total of 1372 patients were randomized (686 to standard care, 686 to early PN). Of 682 patients receiving standard care, 199 patients (29.2%) initially commenced EN, 186 patients (27.3%) initially commenced PN, and 278 patients (40.8%) remained unfed. Time to EN or PN in patients receiving standard care was 2.8 days (95% CI, 2.3 to 3.4). Patients receiving early PN commenced PN a mean of 44 minutes after enrollment (95% CI, 36 to 55). Day-60 mortality did not differ significantly (22.8% for standard care vs 21.5% for early PN; risk difference, -1.26%; 95% CI, -6.6 to 4.1; P = .60). Early PN patients rated day-60 quality of life (RAND-36 General Health Status) statistically, but not clinically meaningfully, higher (45.5 for standard care vs 49.8 for early PN; mean difference, 4.3; 95% CI, 0.95 to 7.58; P = .01). Early PN patients required fewer days of invasive ventilation (7.73 vs 7.26 days per 10 patient × ICU days, risk difference, -0.47; 95% CI, -0.82 to -0.11; P = .01) and, based on Subjective Global Assessment, experienced less muscle wasting (0.43 vs 0.27 score increase per week; mean difference, -0.16; 95% CI, -0.28 to -0.038; P = .01) and fat loss (0.44 vs 0.31 score increase per week; mean difference, -0.13; 95% CI, -0.25 to -0.01; P = .04).The provision of early PN to critically ill adults with relative contraindications to early EN, compared with standard care, did not result in a difference in day-60 mortality. The early PN strategy resulted in significantly fewer days of invasive ventilation but not significantly shorter ICU or hospital stays.anzctr.org.au Identifier: ACTRN012605000704695.Randomized trial of initial trophic versus full-energy enteral nutrition in mechanically ventilated patients with acute respiratory failure.Enteral nutrition is provided to mechanically ventilated patients who cannot eat normally, yet the amount of support needed is unknown. We conducted this randomized, open-label study to test the hypothesis that initial low-volume (i.e., trophic) enteral nutrition would decrease episodes of gastrointestinal intolerance/complications and improve outcomes as compared to initial full-energy enteral nutrition in patients with acute respiratory failure.Randomized, open-label study.A total of 200 patients with acute respiratory failure expected to require mechanical ventilation for at least 72 hrs.Patients were randomized to receive either initial trophic (10 mL/hr) or full-energy enteral nutrition for the initial 6 days of ventilation.The primary outcome measure was ventilator-free days to day 28. Baseline characteristics were similar between the 98 patients randomized to trophic and the 102 patients randomized to full-energy nutrition. At enrollment, patients had a mean Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score of 26.9 and a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 182 and 38% were in shock. Both groups received similar durations of enteral nutrition (5.5 vs. 5.1 days; p = .51). The trophic group received an average of 15.8% ± 11% of goal calories daily through day 6 compared to 74.8% ± 38.5% (p < .001) for the full-energy group. Both groups had a median of 23.0 ventilator-free days (p = .90) and a median of 21.0 intensive-care-unit-free days (p = .64). Mortality to hospital discharge was 22.4% for the trophic group vs. 19.6% for the full-energy group (p = .62). In the first 6 days, the trophic group had trends for less diarrhea (19% vs. 24% of feeding days; p = .08) and significantly fewer episodes of elevated gastric residual volumes (2% vs. 8% of feeding days; p < .001).Initial trophic enteral nutrition resulted in clinical outcomes in mechanically ventilated patients with acute respiratory failure similar to those of early full-energy enteral nutrition but with fewer episodes of gastrointestinal intolerance.Implementation of a nutrition support protocol increases the proportion of mechanically ventilated patients reaching enteral nutrition targets in the adult intensive care unit.Despite the evidence that enteral feeding reduces morbidity in critically ill patients and is preferred to parenteral nutrition, the delivery of enteral nutrition (EN) is often inadequate. The purpose of this study was to determine whether implementation of an evidence-based nutrition support (NS) protocol could improve EN delivery.An NS protocol incorporating available scientific evidence; data from a retrospective survey of 30 intensive care unit (ICU) patients; and input from dietitians, intensive care physicians, surgeons, nurses, and pharmacists was developed. The impact of this protocol was evaluated prospectively in 123 consecutive adult patients admitted to a multisystem ICU who were eligible for EN.The percentage of patients who received at least 80% of their estimated energy requirements during their ICU stay increased from 20% before implementation of the NS protocol to 60% after implementation (p < .001). After adjusting for confounders, those in the postimplementation group received significantly more kcal/kg/d than the preimplementation group (3.71 kcal/kg/d; 95% confidence interval, 1.64 to 5.78; p = .001). Parenteral nutrition use [corrected] was reduced in the postimplementation group (1.6 vs 13%, p = .02). There was no difference in time to initiation of enteral nutrition between groups (1.76 days preprotocol vs 1.44 days postprotocol implementation, p = .9).The development and use of an evidence-based NS protocol improved the proportion of enterally fed ICU patients meeting their calculated nutrition requirements.Permissive underfeeding and intensive insulin therapy in critically ill patients: a randomized controlled trial.Nutritional support has been recognized as an essential part of intensive care unit management. However, the appropriate caloric intake for critically ill patients remains ill defined.We examined the effect of permissive underfeeding compared with that of target feeding and of intensive insulin therapy (IIT) compared with that of conventional insulin therapy (CIT) on the outcomes of critically ill patients.This study had a 2 × 2 factorial, randomized, controlled design. Eligible patients were randomly assigned to permissive underfeeding or target feeding groups (caloric goal: 60-70% compared with 90-100% of calculated requirement, respectively) with either IIT or CIT (target blood glucose: 4.4-6.1 compared with 10-11.1 mmol/L, respectively).Twenty-eight-day all-cause mortality was 18.3% in the permissive underfeeding group compared with 23.3% in the target feeding group (relative risk: 0.79; 95% CI: 0.48, 1.29; P = 0.34). Hospital mortality was lower in the permissive underfeeding group than in the target group (30.0% compared with 42.5%; relative risk: 0.71; 95% CI: 0.50, 0.99; P = 0.04). No significant differences in outcomes were observed between the IIT and CIT groups.In critically ill patients, permissive underfeeding may be associated with lower mortality rates than target feeding. This trial was registered at controlled-trials.com as ISRCTN96294863.Hypocaloric enteral tube feeding in critically ill obese patients.We respectively compared the nutritional and clinical efficacies of eucaloric and hypocaloric enteral feedings in 40 critically ill, obese patients admitted to the trauma or surgical intensive care unit.Adult patients, 18 to 69 years old, with weights greater than 125% of ideal body weight, normal renal and hepatic functions, and who received at least 7 d of enteral tube feeding were studied. Patients were stratified according to feeding group: eucaloric feeding (>or=20 kcal/kg of adjusted weight per day; n = 12) or hypocaloric feeding (<20 kcal/kg of adjusted weight per day; n = 28). The goal protein intake for both groups was approximately 2 g/kg of ideal body weight per day. Clinical events and nutrition data were recorded for 4 wk.Patients were similar according to sex, age, weight, body mass index, Second Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation score, Trauma score, and Injury Severity Score. The hypocaloric feeding group received significantly fewer calories than the eucaloric group (P<or= 0.05). The hypocaloric group had a shorter stay in the intensive care unit (18.6 +/- 9.9 d versus 28.5 +/- 16.1 d, P < 0.03), decreased duration of antibiotic therapy days (16.6 +/- 11.7 d versus 27.4 +/- 17.3 d, P < 0.03), and a trend toward a decrease in days of mechanical ventilation (15.9 +/- 10.8 d versus 23.7 +/- 16.6 d, P = 0.09). There was no statistically significant difference in nitrogen balance or serum prealbumin response between groups.These data suggest that hypocaloric enteral nutrition support is as least as effective as eucaloric feeding in critically ill, obese patients.Permissive Underfeeding or Standard Enteral Feeding in Critically Ill Adults.The appropriate caloric goal for critically ill adults is unclear. We evaluated the effect of restriction of nonprotein calories (permissive underfeeding), as compared with standard enteral feeding, on 90-day mortality among critically ill adults, with maintenance of the full recommended amount of protein in both groups.At seven centers, we randomly assigned 894 critically ill adults with a medical, surgical, or trauma admission category to permissive underfeeding (40 to 60% of calculated caloric requirements) or standard enteral feeding (70 to 100%) for up to 14 days while maintaining a similar protein intake in the two groups. The primary outcome was 90-day mortality.Baseline characteristics were similar in the two groups; 96.8% of the patients were receiving mechanical ventilation. During the intervention period, the permissive-underfeeding group received fewer mean (±SD) calories than did the standard-feeding group (835±297 kcal per day vs. 1299±467 kcal per day, P<0.001; 46±14% vs. 71±22% of caloric requirements, P<0.001). Protein intake was similar in the two groups (57±24 g per day and 59±25 g per day, respectively; P=0.29). The 90-day mortality was similar: 121 of 445 patients (27.2%) in the permissive-underfeeding group and 127 of 440 patients (28.9%) in the standard-feeding group died (relative risk with permissive underfeeding, 0.94; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.76 to 1.16; P=0.58). No serious adverse events were reported; there were no significant between-group differences with respect to feeding intolerance, diarrhea, infections acquired in the intensive care unit (ICU), or ICU or hospital length of stay.Enteral feeding to deliver a moderate amount of nonprotein calories to critically ill adults was not associated with lower mortality than that associated with planned delivery of a full amount of nonprotein calories. (Funded by the King Abdullah International Medical Research Center; PermiT Current Controlled Trials number, ISRCTN68144998.).Permissive underfeeding versus target enteral feeding in adult critically ill patients (PermiT Trial): a study protocol of a multicenter randomized controlled trial.Nutritional support is an essential part of the management of critically ill patients. However, optimal caloric intake has not been systematically evaluated. We aim to compare two strategies of enteral feeding: permissive underfeeding versus target feeding.This is an international multi-center randomized controlled trial in critically ill medical- surgical adult patients. Using a centralized allocation, 862 patients will be randomized to permissive underfeeding or target feeding. Patients in the permissive group receive 50% (acceptable range is 40% to 60%) of the calculated caloric requirement, while those in the targeted group receive 100% (acceptable range 70% to 100%) of the calculated caloric requirement. The primary outcome is 90-day all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes include ICU and hospital mortality, 28-day, and 180-day mortality as well as health care-associated infections, organ failure, and length of stay in the ICU and hospital. The trial has 80% power to detect an 8% absolute reduction in 90-day mortality assuming a baseline risk of death of 25% at an alpha level of 0.05.Patient recruitment started in November 2009 and is currently active in five centers. The Data Monitoring Committee advised continuation of the trial after the first interim analysis. The study is expected to finish by November 2013.Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN68144998.A prospective, randomized trial of intravenous fat emulsion administration in trauma victims requiring total parenteral nutrition.Intravenous fat infusions are a standard component of total parenteral nutrition (TPN). We studied the effects of withholding fat infusions in trauma patients requiring TPN.Polytrauma patients receiving TPN were randomized to receive a standard fat emulsion dose (L) or to have fat infusions withheld (NL) for the first 10 days of TPN. The two groups received the same amino acid and carbohydrate dose (isonitrogenous, nonisocaloric).Clinical outcome parameters were measured. T-cell function was assessed by measuring lymphokine activated killer and natural killer cell activity.Demographics including Injury Severity Score (27 +/- 8; 30 +/- 9) and APACHE II scores (23 +/- 6; 22 +/- 5) were similar for the L (n = 30) and NL (n = 27) groups, respectively. Differences (p < 0.05) were found in length of hospitalization (L = 39 +/- 24; NL = 27 +/- 16), intensive care unit length of stay (L = 29 +/- 22; NL = 18 +/- 12), and days on mechanical ventilation (L = 27 +/- 21; NL = 15 +/- 12). The L group had a higher number of infections (72 in 30) than the NL group (39 in 27) and T-cell function was depressed in this group.Intravenous fat emulsion infusions during the early postinjury period increased susceptibility to infection, prolonged pulmonary failure, and delayed recovery in critically injured patients. It is not clear whether the improved outcome in the NL group was directly related to withholding the fat infusions or due to the hypocaloric nutritional regimen (underfeeding) these patients received.Near-target caloric intake in critically ill medical-surgical patients is associated with adverse outcomes.The objective of this study was to determine whether caloric intake independently influences mortality and morbidity of critically ill patients.The study was conducted as a nested cohort study within a randomized controlled trial in a tertiary care intensive care unit (ICU). The main exposure in the study was average caloric intake/target for the first 7 ICU days. The primary outcomes were ICU and hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included ICU-acquired infections, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), duration of mechanical ventilation days, and ICU and hospital length of stay (LOS). The authors divided patients (n = 523) into 3 tertiles according to the percentage of caloric intake/target: tertile I <33.4%, tertile II 33.4%-64.6%, and tertile III >64.6%. To adjust for potentially confounding variables, the authors assessed the association between caloric intake/target and the different outcomes using multivariate logistic regression for categorical outcomes (tertile I was used as reference) and multiple linear regression for continuous outcomes.Tertile III was associated with higher adjusted hospital mortality, higher risk of ICU-acquired infections, and a trend toward higher VAP rate. Increasing caloric intake was independently associated with a significant increase in duration of mechanical ventilation, ICU LOS, and hospital LOS.The data demonstrate that near-target caloric intake is associated with significantly increased hospital mortality, ICU-acquired infections, mechanical ventilation duration, and ICU and hospital LOS. Further studies are needed to explore whether reducing caloric intake would improve the outcomes in critically ill patients.Early versus late enteral feeding of mechanically ventilated patients: results of a clinical trial.This study sought to compare 2 strategies for the administration of enteral feeding to mechanically ventilated medical patients.The prospective, controlled, clinical trial was carried out in a medical intensive care unit (19 beds) in a university-affiliated, urban teaching hospital. Between May 1999 and December 2000, 150 patients were enrolled. Patients were scheduled to receive their estimated total daily enteral nutritional requirements on either day 1 (early-feeding group) or day 5 (late-feeding group) of mechanical ventilation. Patients in the late-feeding group were also scheduled to receive 20% of their estimated daily enteral nutritional requirements during the first 4 days of mechanical ventilation.Seventy-five (50%) consecutive eligible patients were entered into the early-feeding group and 75 (50%) patients were enrolled in the late-feeding group. During the 5 five days of mechanical ventilation, the total intake of calories (2370 +/- 2000 kcal versus 629 +/- 575 kcal; p < .001) and protein (93.6 +/- 77.2 g versus 26.7 +/- 26.6 g; p < .001) were statistically greater for patients in the early-feeding group. Patients in the early-feeding group had statistically greater incidences of ventilator-associated pneumonia (49.3% versus 30.7%; p = .020) and diarrhea associated with Clostridium difficile infection (13.3% versus 4.0%; p = .042). The early-feeding group also had statistically longer intensive care unit (13.6 +/- 14.2 days versus 9.8 +/- 7.4 days; p = .043) and hospital lengths of stay (22.9 +/- 19.7 days versus 16.7 +/- 12.5 days; p = .023) compared with patients in the late-feeding group. No statistical difference in hospital mortality was observed between patients in the early-feeding and late-feeding groups (20.0% versus 26.7%; p = .334).The administration of more aggressive early enteral nutrition to mechanically ventilated medical patients is associated with greater infectious complications and prolonged lengths of stay in the hospital. Clinicians must balance the potential for complications resulting from early enteral feeding with the expected benefits of such therapy.
