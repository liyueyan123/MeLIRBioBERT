The impact of quadrivalent human papillomavirus (HPV; types 6, 11, 16, and 18) L1 virus-like particle vaccine on infection and disease due to oncogenic nonvaccine HPV types in generally HPV-naive women aged 16-26 years.Human papillomavirus (HPV)-6/11/16/18 vaccine reduces the risk of HPV-6/11/16/18-related cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 1-3 or adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS). Here, its impact on CIN1-3/AIS associated with nonvaccine oncogenic HPV types was evaluated.We enrolled 17,622 women aged 16-26 years. All underwent cervicovaginal sampling and Pap testing at regular intervals for up to 4 years. HPV genotyping was performed for biopsy samples, and histological diagnoses were determined by a pathology panel. Analyses were conducted among subjects who were negative for 14 HPV types on day 1. Prespecified analyses included infection of 6 months' duration and CIN1-3/AIS due to the 2 and 5 most common HPV types in cervical cancer after HPV types 16 and 18, as well as all tested nonvaccine types.Vaccination reduced the incidence of HPV-31/45 infection by 40.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 13.9% to 59.0%) and of CIN1-3/AIS by 43.6% (95% CI, 12.9% to 64.1%), respectively. The reduction in HPV-31/33/45/52/58 infection and CIN1-3/AIS was 25.0% (95% CI, 5.0% to 40.9%) and 29.2% (95% CI, 8.3% to 45.5%), respectively. Efficacy for CIN2-3/AIS associated with the 10 nonvaccine HPV types was 32.5% (95% CI, 6.0% to 51.9%). Reductions were most notable for HPV-31.HPV-6/11/16/18 vaccine reduced the risk of CIN2-3/AIS associated with nonvaccine types responsible for approximately 20% of cervical cancers. The clinical benefit of cross-protection is not expected to be fully additive to the efficacy already observed against HPV-6/11/16/18-related disease, because women may have >1 CIN lesion, each associated with a different HPV type.ClinicalTrials.gov identifiers: NCT00092521 , NCT00092534 , and NCT00092482.Correlation between levels of human papillomavirus (HPV)-16 and 18 antibodies in serum and cervicovaginal secretions in girls and women vaccinated with the HPV-16/18 AS04-adjuvanted vaccine.This pooled analysis of data from four Phase III clinical trials was undertaken to assess the correlation between levels of anti-human papillomavirus (HPV)-16/18 antibodies in serum and cervicovaginal secretions (CVS) in girls and women vaccinated with the HPV-16/18 AS04-adjuvanted vaccine. Serum and CVS samples were collected from a subset of women aged 10-65 years (N=350) at pre-specified time-points from 7 to 36 months post-vaccination. Anti-HPV-16/18 antibody levels in serum and CVS were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Pearson correlation coefficients between serum and CVS antibody levels, standardized for total immunoglobulin G, were calculated at each time-point in women with detectable antibodies in both serum and CVS. All subjects had seroconverted at Month 7 and remained seropositive through Month 36 for both antigens. Geometric mean titers of anti-HPV-16/18 antibodies in serum were substantially higher at all time-points than those in a control group of women who had cleared a natural HPV infection in another trial. In women with detectable antibodies in both serum and CVS, good correlation was seen between HPV-16/18 antibody levels at all time-points (Pearson correlation coefficient: 0.84-0.92 for HPV-16 and 0.90-0.91 for HPV-18). The strong correlation between levels of HPV-16/18 antibodies in serum and CVS up to 36 months post-vaccination in girls and women vaccinated with the HPV-16/18 AS04-adjuvanted vaccine supports transudation of serum antibodies as the mechanism by which antibodies are introduced into CVS. These CVS antibodies may play a role in the protective efficacy of this vaccine.The near disappearance of genital warts in young women 4 years after commencing a national human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination programme.Australia provided free quadrivalent human papillomavirus vaccines to 12-18-year-old girls and women aged ≤26 years from mid-2007 until the end of 2009. After this time, only girls aged 12-13 years had access to free vaccines.Before and after the study, of the proportion of new patients attending Melbourne Sexual Health Centre from mid-2004 to mid-2011, diagnosed with genital warts (GW) by risk group.From July 2004 to June 2011, 52 454 new patients were seen at Melbourne Sexual Health Centre and 5021 (9.6%, 95% CI 9.3% to 9.8%) were diagnosed with GW. From July 2004 to June 2007, the proportions with GW either increased or did not change in all groups. Comparing the two 12-month periods of 2007/2008 and 2010/2011, GW declined in women under 21 years from 18.6% to 1.9% and in heterosexual men under 21 years from 22.9% to 2.9%. The ORs per year for diagnosis of GW adjusted for number of sexual partners from July 2007 until June 2011 in women and heterosexual men <21 years were 0.44 (95% CI 0.32 to 0.58) and 0.42 (95% CI 0.31 to 0.60), respectively. There was no significant change in GW in women ≥30 years (OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.12), heterosexual men ≥30 years (OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.06) or in homosexual men (OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.07).The dramatic decline and near disappearance of GW in women and men under 21 years of age, 4 years after commencing this programme, suggest that the basic reproductive rate has fallen below one.A Phase 1 study of a recombinant viruslike particle vaccine against human papillomavirus type 11 in healthy adult volunteers.Viruslike particles (VLPs) produced from the L1 protein of several papillomaviruses have induced protection from infection after live challenge in animal models. In the present study, the safety and immunogenicity of a human papillomavirus (HPV)--11 L1 VLP candidate vaccine were measured in a phase 1, dose-finding trial in humans. The vaccine was well tolerated and induced high levels of both binding and neutralizing antibodies. Marked increases in lymphoproliferation to HPV--11 L1 antigens were noted after the second vaccination. In addition, lymphoproliferation was induced after vaccination in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) stimulated with heterologous L1 VLP antigens of HPV types 6 and 16. Statistically significant increases in HPV antigen--specific interferon--gamma and interleukin-5 production were measured from PBMC culture supernatants. This candidate HPV VLP vaccine induced robust B and T cell responses, and T cell helper epitopes appear to be conserved across HPV types.Efficacy and safety of prophylactic vaccines against cervical HPV infection and diseases among women: a systematic review & meta-analysis.We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess efficacy and safety of prophylactic HPV vaccines against cervical cancer precursor events in women.Randomized-controlled trials of HPV vaccines were identified from MEDLINE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, conference abstracts and references of identified studies, and assessed by two independent reviewers. Efficacy data were synthesized using fixed-effect models, and evaluated for heterogeneity using I2 statistic.Seven unique trials enrolling 44,142 females were included. The fixed-effect Relative Risk (RR) and 95% confidence intervals were 0.04 (0.01-0.11) and 0.10 (0.03-0.38) for HPV-16 and HPV 18-related CIN2+ in the per-protocol populations (PPP). The corresponding RR was 0.47 (0.36-0.61) and 0.16 (0.08-0.34) in the intention-to-treat populations (ITT). Efficacy against CIN1+ was similar in scale in favor of vaccine. Overall vaccines were highly efficacious against 6-month persistent infection with HPV 16 and 18, both in the PPP cohort (RR: 0.06 [0.04-0.09] and 0.05 [0.03-0.09], respectively), and the ITT cohorts (RR: 0.15 [0.10-0.23] and 0.24 [0.14-0.42], respectively). There was limited prophylactic effect against CIN2+ and 6-month persistent infections associated with non-vaccine oncogenic HPV types. The risk of serious adverse events (RR: 1.00, 0.91-1.09) or vaccine-related serious adverse events (RR: 1.82; 0.79-4.20) did not differ significantly between vaccine and control groups. Data on abnormal pregnancy outcomes were underreported.Prophylactic HPV vaccines are safe, well tolerated, and highly efficacious in preventing persistent infections and cervical diseases associated with vaccine-HPV types among young females. However, long-term efficacy and safety needs to be addressed in future trials.Safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of quadrivalent human papillomavirus (types 6, 11, 16, 18) L1 virus-like-particle vaccine in Latin American women.The prevalence of HPV infection in Latin America is among the highest in the world. A quadrivalent (types 6/11/16/18) human papillomavirus L1 virus-like-particle vaccine has been shown to be 95-100% effective in preventing HPV 6/11/16/18-related cervical and genital disease in women naive to vaccine HPV types. A total of 6,004 female subjects aged 9-24 were recruited from Brazil, Mexico, Colombia, Costa Rica, Guatemala and Peru. Subjects were randomized to immunization with intramuscular (deltoid) injections of HPV vaccine or placebo at enrollment (day 1), month 2 and month 6. Among vaccinated subjects in the per-protocol population from Latin America, quadrivalent HPV vaccine was 92.8 and 100% effective in preventing cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and external genital lesions related to vaccine HPV types, respectively. These data support vaccination of adolescents and young adults in the region, which is expected to greatly reduce the burden of cervical and genital cancers, precancers and genital warts.Immunogenicity and safety of the bivalent HPV vaccine in female patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis: a prospective controlled observational cohort study.To compare the immunogenicity and safety of the bivalent human papillomavirus (HPV)16/18 vaccine between female patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) and healthy female adolescents.68 patients and 55 healthy girls aged 12-18 years were included in a prospective controlled observational cohort and were vaccinated at 0, 1 and 6 months. Primary outcomes were immunogenicity expressed as seropositivity rate after three vaccine doses at 7 and 12 months and HPV-specific geometric mean antibody concentrations. Secondary outcomes were HPV16/18-specific memory B cell responses in a subset of participants and safety, defined as adverse events and the effect of vaccination on JIA disease activity.All participants were seropositive for HPV16 and HPV18 at 7 months. One patient turned seronegative at 12 months for HPV16/18. No significant differences were found between patients and controls in HPV-specific antibody concentrations; however, antibody concentrations were consistently lower in patients. No effect of methotrexate on HPV16 antibodies (p=0.79) or HPV18 antibodies (p=0.37) was detected. All patients on anti-TNFα treatment were seropositive after vaccination. The kinetics of HPV16/18 memory B cell responses was comparable between patients and controls, but the magnitude of B cell responses at 7 and 12 months appeared lower in patients. No relevant differences in adverse events were found. HPV vaccination did not aggravate JIA disease.The bivalent HPV16/18 vaccine is immunogenic and well tolerated in JIA patients. However, HPV-specific antibodies and B cell responses tended to be lower in patients compared with healthy controls.NCT00815282.Safety and reactogenicity of a quadrivalent human papillomavirus (types 6, 11, 16, 18) L1 viral-like-particle vaccine in older adolescents and young adults.Prophylactic vaccination with a quadrivalent HPV (types 6, 11, 16, 18) vaccine (qHPV) has been shown to prevent infection with HPV 6/11/16/18 and associated disease in women and more recently, in men. Here we report on the safety and reactogenicity of the qHPV vaccine in males. A total of 4,065 healthy males aged 16-26 years were enrolled into a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial. Subjects were randomized 1:1 to receive qHPV vaccine or placebo at day 1, month 2, and month 6. Safety and tolerability were assessed via the collection of reported adverse experiences (AEs). All serious AEs (vaccine- or procedure-related or not) and all deaths occurring during the study were recorded. Safety analyses were conducted in all subjects who received at least one dose of vaccine or placebo. The proportion of subjects who reported at least one injection-site AE was higher in the qHPV vaccine group versus the placebo group (60.1% vs 53.7%, respectively), however most of these AEs were mild/moderate in intensity. The incidence of at least one systemic AE was comparable between the vaccine and placebo groups (31.7% vs 31.4%, respectively). There were no vaccine-related serious AEs or deaths. The occurrence of AEs did not increase with each successive injection, and among trial participants who were seropositive for at least one vaccine HPV type at enrollment, the profile of adverse events was similar to that of the entire study cohort. The qHPV vaccine was generally well tolerated in males aged 16-26 years and had a favorable safety profile.Safety and immunogenicity of human papillomavirus-16/18 AS04-adjuvanted vaccine in healthy Chinese females aged 15 to 45 years: a phase I trial.Globally, about 70% of cervical cancers are associated with human papillomavirus (HPV)-16 or HPV-18 infection. A meta-analysis of epidemiologic studies in China showed that HPV was present in 98% of cervical cancer samples. The HPV-16/18 AS04-adjuvanted vaccine Cervarix has shown a high level of protection against HPV-16/18 infections and associated cervical lesions. This phase I trial (NCT00549900) assessed the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of the vaccine in Chinese. Thirty healthy Chinese females, aged 15 to 45 years with a median age of 29.5 years, received three doses of Cervarix in Months 0, 1, and 6. Safety was assessed via recording solicited local and systemic symptoms within 7 days and unsolicited symptoms within 30 days after each vaccination. Serious adverse events, new onset of chronic diseases, and other medically significant conditions were recorded throughout this trial. As an exploratory objective, HPV-16/18 antibody titers were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in serum samples collected in Months 0 and 7. Pain at the injection site was the most frequently reported local symptom. Two subjects reported medically significant adverse events. Both cases were assessed as unrelated to vaccination by the investigator. In Month 7, 100% seroconversion was observed for both anti-HPV-16 and anti-HPV-18 with high geometric mean antibody titers. HPV-16/18 AS04-adjuvanted vaccine, evaluated for the first time in Chinese females, was generally well tolerated and immunogenic, as previously shown in global studies.An open-label, randomized, multicenter study of the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of quadrivalent human papillomavirus (types 6/11/16/18) vaccine given concomitantly with diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, and poliomyelitis vaccine in healthy adolescents 11 to 17 years of age.GARDASIL/SILGARD is a quadrivalent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine with activity against HPV 6/11/16/18. In many countries, GARDASIL is recommended for routine use among adolescents at the same age as other vaccines. In this study, we evaluated the immunogenicity and safety of GARDASIL administered concomitantly with REPEVAX (diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis, and poliomyelitis vaccine).This was an open-label, randomized, multicenter study. We enrolled males (n = 260) and females (n = 583) aged 11 to 17 years. All subjects received a 0.5 mL dose of GARDASIL at day 1, month 2, and month 6, and a 0.5 mL dose of REPEVAX either on day 1 (opposite limb from GARDASIL) or at month 1. Antibody levels for all vaccine components were measured. We monitored systemic and injection-site adverse experiences (AEs) and serious adverse experiences.Immune response for all GARDASIL antigens following concomitant administration of the vaccines was demonstrated noninferior to nonconcomitant administration. Seroconversion for HPV 6, 11, 16, and 18 was >99.7% in both concomitant and nonconcomitant vaccination groups. For REPEVAX, noninferiority of immune response was established for diphtheria, tetanus, and all polio and pertussis antigens. Concomitant administration of the 2 vaccines was generally well-tolerated, although there was a small increase in headache and injection-site swelling in the concomitant group.Overall, concomitant administration of GARDASIL and REPEVAX was generally well-tolerated and did not interfere with the immune response to either vaccine. Concomitant administration of vaccines would minimize the number of visits required to deliver each vaccine individually.Effect of prophylactic human papillomavirus L1 virus-like-particle vaccine on risk of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2, grade 3, and adenocarcinoma in situ: a combined analysis of four randomised clinical trials.Cervical cancer and its obligate precursors, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grades 2 and 3 (CIN2/3), and adenocarcinona in situ (AIS), are caused by oncogenic human papillomavirus (HPV). In this combined analysis of four clinical trials we assessed the effect of prophylactic HPV vaccination on these diseases.20,583 women aged 16-26 years were randomised to receive quadrivalent HPV6/11/16/18 vaccine (n=9087), its HPV16 vaccine component (n=1204), or placebo (n=10 292). They underwent periodic Papanicolaou testing, with colposcopy or biopsy for detected abnormalities. The primary composite endpoint was the combined incidence of HPV16/18-related CIN2/3, AIS, or cervical cancer. These trials are registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, numbers NCT00365378, NCT00365716, NCT00092521, and NCT00092534.Mean follow-up was 3.0 years (SD 0.66) after first dose. In women negative for HPV16 or HPV18 infection during the vaccination regimen (n=17 129, per protocol), vaccine efficacy was 99% for the primary endpoint (95% CI 93-100), meeting the statistical criterion for success. In an intention-to-treat analysis of all randomised women (including those who were HPV16/18 naive or HPV16/18-infected at day 1), efficacy was 44% (95% CI 31-55); all but one case in vaccine recipients occurred in women infected with HPV16 or HPV18 before vaccination. In a second intention-to-treat analysis we noted an 18% reduction (95% CI 7-29) in the overall rate of CIN2/3 or AIS due to any HPV type.Administration of HPV vaccine to HPV-naive women, and women who are already sexually active, could substantially reduce the incidence of HPV16/18-related cervical precancers and cervical cancer.A pilot randomized study to assess immunogenicity, reactogenicity, safety and tolerability of two human papillomavirus vaccines administered intramuscularly and intradermally to females aged 18-26 years.Intradermal administration of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines could be dose-sparing and cost-saving. This pilot randomized study assessed Cervarix(®) and Gardasil(®) administered either intramuscularly or intradermally, in different doses (full-dose or reduced to 20%) by different methods (needle and syringe or PharmaJet needle-free jet injection device). Following an initial reactogenicity study of 10 male subjects, sexually naïve women aged 18-26 years were randomized to the eight study groups to receive vaccine at 0, 2 and 6 months. 42 female subjects were enrolled and complete data were available for 40 subjects. Intradermal administration of either vaccine raised no safety concerns but was more reactogenic than intramuscular administration, although still tolerable. All subjects demonstrated a seroconversion (titre≥1:320) by Day 95. Further evaluation of intradermal HPV vaccination and its potential for cost reduction in resource poor settings is warranted.Reduced prevalence of oral human papillomavirus (HPV) 4 years after bivalent HPV vaccination in a randomized clinical trial in Costa Rica.Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, particularly with type 16, causes a growing fraction of oropharyngeal cancers, whose incidence is increasing, mainly in developed countries. In a double-blind controlled trial conducted to investigate vaccine efficacy (VE) of the bivalent HPV 16/18 vaccine against cervical infections and lesions, we estimated VE against prevalent oral HPV infections 4 years after vaccination.A total of 7,466 women 18-25 years old were randomized (1∶1) to receive the HPV16/18 vaccine or hepatitis A vaccine as control. At the final blinded 4-year study visit, 5,840 participants provided oral specimens (91·9% of eligible women) to evaluate VE against oral infections. Our primary analysis evaluated prevalent oral HPV infection among all vaccinated women with oral and cervical HPV results. Corresponding VE against prevalent cervical HPV16/18 infection was calculated for comparison. Oral prevalence of identifiable mucosal HPV was relatively low (1·7%). Approximately four years after vaccination, there were 15 prevalent HPV16/18 infections in the control group and one in the vaccine group, for an estimated VE of 93·3% (95% CI = 63% to 100%). Corresponding efficacy against prevalent cervical HPV16/18 infection for the same cohort at the same visit was 72·0% (95% CI = 63% to 79%) (p versus oral VE = 0·04). There was no statistically significant protection against other oral HPV infections, though power was limited for these analyses.HPV prevalence four years after vaccination with the ASO4-adjuvanted HPV16/18 vaccine was much lower among women in the vaccine arm compared to the control arm, suggesting that the vaccine affords strong protection against oral HPV16/18 infection, with potentially important implications for prevention of increasingly common HPV-associated oropharyngeal cancer. ClinicalTrials.gov, Registry number NCT00128661.Efficacy of a bivalent HPV 16/18 vaccine against anal HPV 16/18 infection among young women: a nested analysis within the Costa Rica Vaccine Trial.Anal cancer remains rare (incidence of about 1·5 per 100,000 women yearly), but rates are increasing in many countries. Human papillomavirus (HPV) 16 and 18 infections cause most cases of anal cancer. We assessed efficacy of an AS04-adjuvanted HPV 16 and HPV 18 vaccine against anal infection with HPV 16, HPV 18, or both (HPV 16/18).Women from Costa Rica were registered between June 28, 2004, and Dec 21, 2005, in a randomised double-blind controlled trial that was designed to assess vaccine efficacy against persistent cervical HPV 16/18 infections and associated precancerous lesions. Eligible women were residents of Guanacaste and selected areas of Puntarenas, Costa Rica, age 18-25 years, in good general health, willing to provide informed consent, and were not pregnant or breastfeeding. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive an HPV vaccine (Cervarix, GlaxoSmithKline, Rixensart, Belgium) or a control hepatitis A vaccine (modified preparation of Havrix, GlaxoSmithKline, Rixensart, Belgium). Vaccines were administered in three 0·5 mL doses at enrolment, 1 month, and 6 months. Women, selected at the final blinded study visit 4 years after vaccination, provided anal specimens for assessment of vaccine efficacy against anal HPV 16/18 infection. Prevalence of anal HPV 16/18 infections, reported as vaccine efficacy, was the primary endpoint of the study described here. Vaccine efficacy against cervical HPV 16/18 infection in the same women at the 4-year visit was used as a comparator. Analyses were done in a restricted cohort of women who were negative for both cervical HPV 16 and HPV 18 DNA and who were HPV 16 and HPV 18 seronegative before enrolment (HPV naive), and also in the full cohort of women who provided an anal specimen. Investigators were masked to group assignment. This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00128661.All women who attended the final blinded study visit and consented to anal specimen collection were included in the analysis (4210 of 6352 eligible women). In the full cohort, vaccine efficacy against prevalent HPV 16/18 infection measured one-time, 4 years post vaccination was lower at the anus (62·0%, 95% CI 47·1-73·1) compared with the cervix (76·4%, 67·0-83·5; p for interaction by anatomical site 0·031). In the restricted cohort, vaccine efficacy against anal HPV 16/18 infection was 83·6% (66·7-92·8), which was similar to vaccine efficacy against cervical HPV 16/18 infection (87·9%, 77·4-94·0). Safety issues were not addressed in the current analysis. Additional safety data will be published later in a separate article.The AS04-adjuvanted vaccine affords strong protection against anal HPV infection, particularly among women more likely to be HPV naive at enrolment.National Cancer Institute with contributions from the National Institutes of Health Office of Research on Women's Health. Vaccine was provided by GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals.A phase I study to evaluate a human papillomavirus (HPV) type 18 L1 VLP vaccine.Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection can cause genital warts and cervical cancer. HPV types 6 and 11 cause >90% of genital wart cases; HPV16 and 18 cause 70% of cervical cancers. A prophylactic HPV (types 6, 11, 16, 18) L1 virus-like particle (VLP) vaccine may substantially reduce the incidence of these lesions. This report describes the results of a phase I study of the HPV18 component of such a vaccine. Forty women were randomized to receive either HPV18 L1 VLP vaccine or placebo. Anti-HPV18 responses were measured using a competitive radioimmunoassay (cRIA). Tolerability was evaluated using vaccination report cards (VRC). The study showed that the HPV18 L1 VLP vaccine was generally well-tolerated and highly immunogenic. Peak anti-HPV18 geometric mean titers (GMT) in vaccines were 60-fold greater than those observed in women following natural HPV18 infection. Further studies of a multivalent HPV L1 VLP vaccines are warranted.Impact of baseline covariates on the immunogenicity of a quadrivalent (types 6, 11, 16, and 18) human papillomavirus virus-like-particle vaccine.The quadrivalent (types 6, 11, 16, and 18) human papillomavirus (HPV) L1 virus-like-particle vaccine was 95%-100% effective in preventing cervical and genital disease related to HPV-6, -11, -16, and -18. Vaccine efficacy is thought to be mediated by humoral immunity. Here, we analyze the effect of the baseline characteristics of subjects on vaccine-induced immune responses.Immunogenicity data from 12,343 subjects 9-26 years old randomized to quadrivalent HPV vaccine or placebo in phase 2/3 studies were analyzed. Covariates examined were day 1 HPV serostatus, age, race/ethnicity, region of residence, lactation status, hormonal contraceptive usage, smoking status, Pap test diagnosis, immunosuppressant or anti-inflammatory agent use, and number of sex partners. Anti-HPV responses were summarized as serum anti-HPV-6, -11, -16, or -18 geometric mean titers 1 month after dose 3.Age at vaccination initiation was inversely proportional to the vaccine-induced anti-HPV response. Vaccination of subpopulations of subjects who were seropositive at day 1 to a vaccine HPV type resulted in more robust anti-HPV responses to that type, compared with those in subjects who were seronegative at baseline. Anti-HPV responses were comparable among the remaining demographic subgroups.The immunogenicity of quadrivalent HPV vaccine was comparable among subjects with differing baseline characteristics. These data support vaccination with quadrivalent HPV vaccine across a broad range of baseline subject characteristics.Efficacy of a quadrivalent prophylactic human papillomavirus (types 6, 11, 16, and 18) L1 virus-like-particle vaccine against high-grade vulval and vaginal lesions: a combined analysis of three randomised clinical trials.Vulval and vaginal cancers among younger women are often related to infection with human papillomavirus (HPV). These cancers are preceded by high-grade vulval intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN2-3) and vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia (VaIN2-3). Our aim was to do a combined analysis of three randomised clinical trials to assess the effect of a prophylactic quadrivalent HPV vaccine on the incidence of these diseases.18 174 women (16-26 years) were enrolled and randomised to receive either quadrivalent HPV6/11/16/18 L1 virus-like-particle vaccine or placebo at day 1, and months 2 and 6. Individuals underwent detailed anogenital examination at day 1, 1 month after dose three, and at 6-12-month intervals for up to 48 months. Suspect genital lesions were biopsied and read by a panel of pathologists and vaccine HPV type-specific DNA testing was done. The primary endpoint was the combined incidence of VIN2-3 or VaIN2-3 associated with HPV16 or HPV18. Primary efficacy analyses were done in a per-protocol population.The mean follow-up time was 3 years. Among women naive to HPV16 or HPV18 through 1 month after dose three (per-protocol population; vaccine n=7811; placebo n=7785), the vaccine was 100% effective (95% CI 72-100) against VIN2-3 or VaIN2-3 associated with HPV16 or HPV18. In the intention-to-treat population (which included 18 174 women who, at day 1, could have been infected with HPV16 or HPV18), vaccine efficacy against VIN2-3 or VaIN2-3 associated with HPV16 or HPV18 was 71% (37-88). The vaccine was 49% (18-69) effective against all VIN2-3 or VaIN2-3, irrespective of whether or not HPV DNA was detected in the lesion. The most common treatment-related adverse event was injection-site pain.Prophylactic administration of quadrivalent HPV vaccine was effective in preventing high-grade vulval and vaginal lesions associated with HPV16 or HPV18 infection in women who were naive to these types before vaccination. With time, such vaccination could result in reduced rates of HPV-related vulval and vaginal cancers.HPV catch-up vaccination of young women: a systematic review and meta-analysis.While prophylactic human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccination is considered effective in young girls, it is unclear whether a catch-up vaccination of older girls would be beneficial. We, therefore, aimed to examine the potential health impact of a HPV catch-up vaccination of girls who were too old at the time of vaccine introduction, hence aged 16 and older.We systematically searched the literature for randomized clinical trials (RCTs) that examined the effect of HPV vaccines on overall mortality, cancer mortality and incidence, high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 and higher (CIN2+), vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN) and vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia (VaIN) grade 2 and higher lesions (VIN2+ and VaIN2+, respectively) genital warts (condyloma). We considered all lesions and those associated with HPV type(s) included in the vaccines. RCTs reporting on serious adverse events were also eligible. Selected publications were assessed for potential risk of bias, and we ascertained the overall quality of the evidence for each outcome using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE). Meta-analyses were performed, assuming both random and fixed effects, to estimate risk ratios (RR) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI), using intention-to-treat and per-protocol populations.We included 46 publications reporting on 13 RCTs. Most of the RCTs had a maximum follow-up period of four years. We identified no RCT reporting on the effect of HPV catch vaccination on overall and cancer related mortality, and on cervical cancer incidence. We found a borderline protective effect of a HPV catch-up vaccination on all CIN2+, with a pooled RR of 0.80 (95% CI: 0.62-1.02) for a follow-up period of 4 years. A HPV catch-up vaccination was associated with a reduction in VIN2+ and VaIN2+ lesions, and condyloma. No difference in risk of serious adverse events was seen in vaccinated participants versus unvaccinated women (pooled RR of 0.99 (0.91-1.08)).This systematic review indicates that a HPV catch-up vaccination could be beneficial, however the long-term effect of such a vaccination, and its effect on cervical cancer incidence and mortality is still unclear.Prior human papillomavirus-16/18 AS04-adjuvanted vaccination prevents recurrent high grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia after definitive surgical therapy: Post-hoc analysis from a randomized controlled trial.We evaluated the efficacy of the human papillomavirus (HPV)-16/18 AS04-adjuvanted vaccine in preventing HPV-related disease after surgery for cervical lesions in a post-hoc analysis of the PApilloma TRIal against Cancer In young Adults (PATRICIA; NCT00122681). Healthy women aged 15-25 years were randomized (1:1) to receive vaccine or control at months 0, 1 and 6 and followed for 4 years. Women were enrolled regardless of their baseline HPV DNA status, HPV-16/18 serostatus, or cytology, but excluded if they had previous or planned colposcopy. The primary and secondary endpoints of PATRICIA have been reported previously; the present post-hoc analysis evaluated efficacy in a subset of women who underwent an excisional procedure for cervical lesions after vaccination. The main outcome was the incidence of subsequent HPV-related cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or greater (CIN2+) 60 days or more post-surgery. Other outcomes included the incidence of HPV-related CIN1+, and vulvar or vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN/VaIN) 60 days or more post-surgery. Of the total vaccinated cohort of 18,644 women (vaccine = 9,319; control = 9,325), 454 (vaccine = 190, control = 264) underwent an excisional procedure during the trial. Efficacy 60 days or more post-surgery for a first lesion, irrespective of HPV DNA results, was 88.2% (95% CI: 14.8, 99.7) against CIN2+ and 42.6% (-21.1, 74.1) against CIN1+. No VIN was reported and one woman in each group had VaIN2+ 60 days or more post-surgery. Women who undergo surgical therapy for cervical lesions after vaccination with the HPV-16/18 vaccine may continue to benefit from vaccination, with a reduced risk of developing subsequent CIN2+.A pooled analysis of continued prophylactic efficacy of quadrivalent human papillomavirus (Types 6/11/16/18) vaccine against high-grade cervical and external genital lesions.Quadrivalent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine has been shown to provide protection from HPV 6/11/16/18-related cervical, vaginal, and vulvar disease through 3 years. We provide an update on the efficacy of the quadrivalent HPV vaccine against high-grade cervical, vaginal, and vulvar lesions based on end-of-study data from three clinical trials. Additionally, we stratify vaccine efficacy by several baseline characteristics, including age, smoking status, and Papanicolaou (Pap) test results. A total of 18,174 females ages 16 to 26 years were randomized and allocated into one of three clinical trials (protocols 007, 013, and 015). Vaccine or placebo was given at baseline, month 2, and month 6. Pap testing was conducted at regular intervals. Cervical and anogenital swabs were collected for HPV DNA testing. Examination for the presence of vulvar and vaginal lesions was also done. Endpoints included high-grade cervical, vulvar, or vaginal lesions (CIN 2/3, VIN 2/3, or VaIN 2/3). Mean follow-up time was 42 months post dose 1. Vaccine efficacy against HPV 6/11/16/18-related high-grade cervical lesions in the per-protocol and intention-to-treat populations was 98.2% [95% confidence interval (95% CI), 93.3-99.8] and 51.5% (95% CI, 40.6-60.6), respectively. Vaccine efficacy against HPV 6/11/16/18-related high-grade vulvar and vaginal lesions in the per-protocol and intention-to-treat populations was 100.0% (95% CI, 82.6-100.0) and 79.0% (95% CI, 56.4-91.0), respectively. Efficacy in the intention-to-treat population tended to be lower in older women, women with more partners, and women with abnormal Pap test results. The efficacy of quadrivalent HPV vaccine against high-grade cervical and external anogenital neoplasia remains high through 42 months post vaccination.Efficacy of quadrivalent HPV vaccine against HPV Infection and disease in males.Infection with human papillomavirus (HPV) and diseases caused by HPV are common in boys and men. We report on the safety of a quadrivalent vaccine (active against HPV types 6, 11, 16, and 18) and on its efficacy in preventing the development of external genital lesions and anogenital HPV infection in boys and men.We enrolled 4065 healthy boys and men 16 to 26 years of age, from 18 countries in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial. The primary efficacy objective was to show that the quadrivalent HPV vaccine reduced the incidence of external genital lesions related to HPV-6, 11, 16, or 18. Efficacy analyses were conducted in a per-protocol population, in which subjects received all three vaccinations and were negative for relevant HPV types at enrollment, and in an intention-to-treat population, in which subjects received vaccine or placebo, regardless of baseline HPV status.In the intention-to-treat population, 36 external genital lesions were seen in the vaccine group as compared with 89 in the placebo group, for an observed efficacy of 60.2% (95% confidence interval [CI], 40.8 to 73.8); the efficacy was 65.5% (95% CI, 45.8 to 78.6) for lesions related to HPV-6, 11, 16, or 18. In the per-protocol population, efficacy against lesions related to HPV-6, 11, 16, or 18 was 90.4% (95% CI, 69.2 to 98.1). Efficacy with respect to persistent infection with HPV-6, 11, 16, or 18 and detection of related DNA at any time was 47.8% (95% CI, 36.0 to 57.6) and 27.1% (95% CI, 16.6 to 36.3), respectively, in the intention-to-treat population and 85.6% (97.5% CI, 73.4 to 92.9) and 44.7% (95% CI, 31.5 to 55.6) in the per-protocol population. Injection-site pain was significantly more frequent among subjects receiving quadrivalent HPV vaccine than among those receiving placebo (57% vs. 51%, P<0.001).Quadrivalent HPV vaccine prevents infection with HPV-6, 11, 16, and 18 and the development of related external genital lesions in males 16 to 26 years of age. (Funded by Merck and others; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00090285.).Immunogenicity and safety of Gardasil among mid-adult aged men (27-45 years)--The MAM Study.The quadrivalent (types 6/11/16/18) human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine, Gardasil, has demonstrated efficacy against persistent HPV infection and associated anogenital disease in males. The goal of this Phase II trial was to establish the immunogenicity and safety of Gardasil among mid-adult men ages 27-45 years.One hundred and fifty men from Tampa, FL, US, and Cuernavaca, Mexico who met eligibility criteria (male, 27-45 years old, completed four years of follow-up in the HPV Infection in Men (HIM) natural history study) were enrolled. Subjects completed four visits over seven months, with Gardasil administered at Day 1 and Months 2 and 6. Sera were collected at Day 1 (pre-vaccination) and Month 7 (one month post-dose three). Anti-HPV6, 11, 16, and 18 IgG levels were determined by competitive Luminex immunoassay.100% of men seroconverted to each of the four HPV vaccine components, and the vaccine was generally well-tolerated. Antibody responses to vaccine did not differ by age group or sexual orientation, regardless of HPV type, and were significantly higher at Month 7 among men who entered the trial seropositive for HPV 6 or 11.The immune response to HPV vaccination in men ages 27-45 was comparable to that observed in younger men, in whom clinical efficacy was demonstrated. Further trials to assess the efficacy of HPV vaccines to prevent persistent HPV infections in mid-adult men are needed.Merck & Co. Inc. was the main sponsor of this trial (IISP39256) and provided the study product.Efficacy and safety of human papillomavirus vaccine for primary prevention of cervical cancer: A review of evidence from phase III trials and national programs.The Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines have been widely introduced in the national immunization programs in most of the medium and high income countries following endorsement from national and international advisory bodies. HPV vaccine is unique and its introduction is challenging in many ways - it is the first vaccine developed to prevent any cancer, the vaccine is gender specific, it targets adolescent females who are difficult to reach by any health intervention programs. It is not unusual for such a vaccine to face scepticism and reservations not only from lay public but also from professionals in spite of the clinical trial results convincingly and consistently proving their efficacy and safety. Over the last few years millions of doses of the HPV vaccine have been administered round the world and the efficacy and safety data have started coming from the real life programs. A comprehensive cervical cancer control program involving HPV vaccination of the adolescent girls and screening of the adult women has been proved to be the most cost-effective approach to reduce the burden of cervical cancer. The present article discusses the justification of HPV vaccination in the backdrop of natural history of cervical cancer, the mechanism of action of the vaccines, efficacy and safety data from phase III randomized controlled trials as well as from the national immunization programs of various countries. Randomized trial of the immunogenicity and safety of the Hepatitis B vaccine given in an accelerated schedule coadministered with the human papillomavirus type 16/18 AS04-adjuvanted cervical cancer vaccine.The human papillomavirus type 16/18 (HPV-16/18) AS04-adjuvanted cervical cancer vaccine is licensed for females aged 10 years and above and is therefore likely to be coadministered with other licensed vaccines, such as hepatitis B. In this randomized, open-label study, we compared the immunogenicity of the hepatitis B vaccine administered alone (HepB group) or with the HPV-16/18 AS04-adjuvanted vaccine (HepB+HPV group) in healthy women aged 20 to 25 years (clinical trial NCT00637195). The hepatitis B vaccine was given at 0, 1, 2, and 12 months (an accelerated schedule which may be required by women at high risk), and the HPV-16/18 vaccine was given at 0, 1, and 6 months. One month after the third dose of hepatitis B vaccine, in the according-to-protocol cohort (n = 72 HepB+HPV; n = 76 HepB), hepatitis B seroprotection rates (titer of ≥10 mIU/ml) were 96.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 87.5 to 99.6) and 96.9% (CI, 89.2 to 99.6) in the HepB+HPV and HepB groups, respectively, in women initially seronegative for anti-hepatitis B surface antigen (HBs) and anti-hepatitis B core antigen (HBc). Corresponding geometric mean titers of anti-HBs antibodies were 60.2 mIU/ml (CI, 40.0 to 90.5) and 71.3 mIU/ml (CI, 53.9 to 94.3). Anti-HBs antibody titers rose substantially after the fourth dose of hepatitis B vaccine. All women initially seronegative for anti-HPV-16 and anti-HPV-18 antibodies seroconverted after the second HPV-16/18 vaccine dose and remained seropositive up to 1 month after the third dose. Both vaccines were generally well tolerated, with no difference in reactogenicity between groups. In conclusion, coadministration of the HPV-16/18 AS04-adjuvanted vaccine did not affect the immunogenicity or safety of the hepatitis B vaccine administered in an accelerated schedule in young women.Immunogenicity of the quadrivalent human papillomavirus (type 6/11/16/18) vaccine in males 16 to 26 years old.Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection can lead to significant disease in males, including anogenital warts, intraepithelial neoplasias, and several types of oral and anogenital cancers. The quadrivalent HPV (type 6/11/16/18) L1 virus-like particle (VLP) vaccine (qHPV vaccine; Gardasil) has recently been demonstrated to prevent persistent infection and associated disease related to vaccine HPV types in males. We report the overall immunogenicity results from a trial of the quadrivalent HPV vaccine in males. Overall, 3,463 heterosexual men and 602 men who had sex with men were enrolled into a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy study. Serum samples were collected prior to vaccination at day 1 and at months 7, 24, and 36 postvaccination. Immunogenicity was evaluated with a multiplex, competitive Luminex immunoassay. Almost all subjects (97.4 to 99.2%) seroconverted for vaccine HPV types by month 7. At month 36, 88.9%, 94.0%, 97.9%, and 57.0% of subjects were still seropositive for HPV-6, -11, -16, and -18, respectively. For all vaccine HPV types, black subjects had significantly higher antibody titers at month 7 than did both Caucasian and Asian subjects. An anamnestic antibody response was seen in men seropositive before vaccination. The vaccine was highly immunogenic in males 16 to 23 years of age; responses were comparable to those observed in women. Furthermore, the immune responses were consistent with the established efficacy of the vaccine in the prevention of incident and persistent HPV infection, anogenital warts, and anal intraepithelial neoplasia.Immunization of early adolescent females with human papillomavirus type 16 and 18 L1 virus-like particle vaccine containing AS04 adjuvant.In female individuals 15-25-years of age, the AS04-containing human papillomavirus (HPV)-16/18 vaccine is highly immunogenic and provides up to 100% protection against HPV-16/18 persistent infection and associated cervical lesions up to 4.5 years. Optimal cervical cancer prevention will require prophylactic vaccination against oncogenic HPV 16 and 18 before the onset of sexual activity in early adolescent girls. To establish the feasibility of vaccination in girls 10-14 years of age, we compared the immunogenicity and safety in early adolescent female individuals to those 15-25 years in whom vaccine efficacy has been demonstrated.We enrolled 773 female participants aged 10-14 years and 15-25 years to receive the HPV-16/18 L1 VLP AS04 vaccine, which was administered at months 0, 1, and 6. Serum samples were collected at months 0 and 7; antibodies to HPV 16 and 18 VLPs were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Vaccine safety was assessed at 7 or 30 days after each dose; serious adverse events were recorded during the entire study period.Both age groups achieved 100% seroconversion for HPV 16 and 18. Participants in the group aged 10-14 years were not only noninferior to those 15-25 years in terms of HPV 16 and 18 seroconversion rates but also had approximately twice as high geometric mean titers. The vaccine was generally safe and well tolerated.These findings suggest that HPV vaccination during early adolescence is generally safe, well tolerated, and highly immunogenic. The observed higher antibody titers in the group 10-14 years of age are likely to result in longer antibody persistence. Overall, these data support the implementation of prophylactic HPV vaccination in this age group.HPV vaccination coverage among women aged 18-20 years in Germany three years after recommendation of HPV vaccination for adolescent girls: results from a cross-sectional survey.Routine immunization of adolescent girls aged 12-17 y against human papillomavirus (HPV) was recommended in Germany in March 2007. We aimed to assess HPV-vaccine uptake and knowledge about post-vaccination cervical cancer screening and condom use in women aged 18-20 years, three years after adoption of HPV-vaccination into the routine vaccination schedule.Overall 2,001 females participated in our study. Of these, 49% reported receipt of a complete three-dose course of HPV-vaccines; 11% received 1 or 2 doses. Living in East Germany, high educational status, and interest in health-related issues were independently associated with HPV-vaccination. Misconceptions among survey-participants were rare: Only 8% believed that HPV-vaccination would obviate the need for cervical screening and 1% that condom use would be dispensible after vaccination.In 2010, a nationwide cross-sectional telephone-survey was performed among randomly-selected women aged 18-20 years living in Germany. Telephone interviews were conducted by a large professional market research institute as part of a daily omnibus survey.HPV-vaccination coverage is low in Germany. The results indicate that there is an urgent need for the implementation of a coordinated adolescent vaccination program to facilitate access to vaccination, including balanced information tailored to this age group. Otherwise, the HPV-vaccination effort will fall short of reaching its maximum public health benefit.Multisite HPV16/18 Vaccine Efficacy Against Cervical, Anal, and Oral HPV Infection.Previous Costa Rica Vaccine Trial (CVT) reports separately demonstrated vaccine efficacy against HPV16 and HPV18 (HPV16/18) infections at the cervical, anal, and oral regions; however, the combined overall multisite efficacy (protection at all three sites) and vaccine efficacy among women infected with HPV16 or HPV18 prior to vaccination are less known.Women age 18 to 25 years from the CVT were randomly assigned to the HPV16/18 vaccine (Cervarix) or a hepatitis A vaccine. Cervical, oral, and anal specimens were collected at the four-year follow-up visit from 4186 women. Multisite and single-site vaccine efficacies (VEs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were computed for one-time detection of point prevalent HPV16/18 in the cervical, anal, and oral regions four years after vaccination. All statistical tests were two-sided.The multisite woman-level vaccine efficacy was highest among "naïve" women (HPV16/18 seronegative and cervical HPV high-risk DNA negative at vaccination) (vaccine efficacy = 83.5%, 95% CI = 72.1% to 90.8%). Multisite woman-level vaccine efficacy was also demonstrated among women with evidence of a pre-enrollment HPV16 or HPV18 infection (seropositive for HPV16 and/or HPV18 but cervical HPV16/18 DNA negative at vaccination) (vaccine efficacy = 57.8%, 95% CI = 34.4% to 73.4%), but not in those with cervical HPV16 and/or HPV18 DNA at vaccination (anal/oral HPV16/18 VE = 25.3%, 95% CI = -40.4% to 61.1%). Concordant HPV16/18 infections at two or three sites were also less common in HPV16/18-infected women in the HPV vaccine vs control arm (7.4% vs 30.4%, P < .001).This study found high multisite vaccine efficacy among "naïve" women and also suggests the vaccine may provide protection against HPV16/18 infections at one or more anatomic sites among some women infected with these types prior to HPV16/18 vaccination.Four year efficacy of prophylactic human papillomavirus quadrivalent vaccine against low grade cervical, vulvar, and vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia and anogenital warts: randomised controlled trial.To evaluate the prophylactic efficacy of the human papillomavirus (HPV) quadrivalent vaccine in preventing low grade cervical, vulvar, and vaginal intraepithelial neoplasias and anogenital warts (condyloma acuminata).Data from two international, double blind, placebo controlled, randomised efficacy trials of quadrivalent HPV vaccine (protocol 013 (FUTURE I) and protocol 015 (FUTURE II)). The trials were to be 4 years in length, and the results reported are from final study data of 42 months' follow-up.Primary care centres and university or hospital associated health centres in 24 countries and territories around the world.17 622 women aged 16-26 years enrolled between December 2001 and May 2003. Major exclusion criteria were lifetime number of sexual partners (>4), history of abnormal cervical smear test results, and pregnancy.Three doses of quadrivalent HPV vaccine (for serotypes 6, 11, 16, and 18) or placebo at day 1, month 2, and month 6.Vaccine efficacy against cervical, vulvar, and vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia grade I and condyloma in a per protocol susceptible population that included subjects who received all three vaccine doses, tested negative for the relevant vaccine HPV types at day 1 and remained negative through month 7, and had no major protocol violations. Intention to treat, generally HPV naive, and unrestricted susceptible populations were also studied.In the per protocol susceptible population, vaccine efficacy against lesions related to the HPV types in the vaccine was 96% for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade I (95% confidence interval 91% to 98%), 100% for both vulvar and vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia grade I (95% CIs 74% to 100%, 64% to 100% respectively), and 99% for condyloma (96% to 100%). Vaccine efficacy against any lesion (regardless of HPV type) in the generally naive population was 30% (17% to 41%), 75% (22% to 94%), and 48% (10% to 71%) for cervical, vulvar, and vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia grade I, respectively, and 83% (74% to 89%) for condyloma.Quadrivalent HPV vaccine provided sustained protection against low grade lesions attributable to vaccine HPV types (6, 11, 16, and 18) and a substantial reduction in the burden of these diseases through 42 months of follow-up.NCT00092521 and NCT00092534.Effect of human papillomavirus 16/18 L1 viruslike particle vaccine among young women with preexisting infection: a randomized trial.Viruslike particle human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines were designed to prevent HPV infection and development of cervical precancers and cancer. Women with oncogenic HPV infections might consider vaccination as therapy.To determine whether vaccination against HPV types 16 and 18 increases the rate of viral clearance in women already infected with HPV.Phase 3, masked, community-based randomized trial conducted in 2 provinces of Costa Rica.A total of 2189 women aged 18 to 25 years who were recruited between June 2004 and December 2005. Participants were positive for HPV DNA at enrollment, had at least 6 months of follow-up, and had follow-up HPV DNA results.Participants were randomly assigned to receive 3 doses of a bivalent HPV-16/18 L1 protein viruslike particle AS04 candidate vaccine (n = 1088) or a control hepatitis A vaccine (n = 1101) over 6 months.Presence of HPV DNA was determined in cervical specimins by a molecular hybridization assay using chemiluminescence with HPV RNA probes and by polymerase chain reaction using SPF10 primers and a line probe assay detection system before vaccination and by polymerase chain reaction after vaccination. We compared rates of type-specific viral clearance using generalized estimating equations methods at the 6-month visit (after 2 doses) and 12-month visit (after 3 doses) in the 2 study groups.There was no evidence of increased viral clearance at 6 or 12 months in the group who received HPV vaccine compared with the control group. Clearance rates for HPV-16/18 infections at 6 months were 33.4% (82/248) in the HPV vaccine group and 31.6% (95/298) in the control group (vaccine efficacy for viral clearance, 2.5%; 95% confidence interval, -9.8% to 13.5%). Human papillomavirus 16/18 clearance rates at 12 months were 48.8% (86/177) in the HPV vaccine group and 49.8% (110/220) in the control group (vaccine efficacy for viral clearance, -2.0%; 95% confidence interval, -24.3% to 16.3%). There was no evidence of a therapeutic effect for other oncogenic or nononcogenic HPV categories, among women receiving all vaccine doses, among women with single infections, or among women stratified by the following entry variables: HPV-16/18 serology, cytologic results, HPV DNA viral load, time since sexual debut, Chlamydia trachomatis or Neisseria gonorrhoeae infection, hormonal contraceptive use, or smoking.In women positive for HPV DNA, HPV-16/18 vaccination does not accelerate clearance of the virus and should not be used to treat prevalent infections.clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00128661.Safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of gardasil given concomitantly with Menactra and Adacel.Multinational phase III trials of a human papillomavirus vaccine, Gardasil, have shown the vaccine to be generally well-tolerated, efficacious, and immunogenic. We evaluated the immunogenicity and safety of Gardasil administered concomitantly with Menactra and Adacel.In this open-label study, boys (n = 394) and girls (n = 648) aged 10 to 17 were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio as follows: group A (concomitant administration) received a 0.5-mL dose of Gardasil at day 1, month 2, and month 6 and a 0.5-mL dose of Menactra and Adacel on day 1; group B (nonconcomitant administration) received Gardasil at day 1, month 2, and month 6 and Menactra and Adacel at month 1. Antibody levels for all vaccine components were measured. Systemic, injection-site, and serious adverse experiences (AEs) were monitored.Immune responses after concomitant administration of the 3 vaccines were noninferior to nonconcomitant administration. Seroconversion for Gardasil was > or = 99% in both groups A and B. For Menactra and Adacel, concomitant administration of the vaccines was demonstrated to be noninferior to nonconcomitant administration. Concomitant administration was generally well-tolerated. No participants withdrew because of an AE. One serious AE of transient muscular weakness of <24 hours' duration after the third Gardasil injection was reported in group B and was deemed possibly vaccine-related by the investigator.Overall, concomitant administration was generally well-tolerated and did not interfere with the immune response to the respective vaccines. Concomitant administration should minimize the number of visits required to deliver each vaccine individually, leading to increased compliance and more effective disease prevention.Cross-protective vaccine efficacy of the bivalent HPV vaccine against HPV31 is associated with humoral immune responses: results from the Costa Rica Vaccine Trial.We investigated the role of antibody responses as potential mechanism for the cross-protective vaccine-efficacies (VE) observed from randomized clinical trials of the HPV16/18 bivalent vaccine. Results HPV31 cases had lower HPV16 antibody levels than controls (OR 4th quartile compared with 1st quartile = 0.63; 95%CI: 0.36-1.08; p-trend = 0.03). HPV31 cases were also less likely to have detectable HPV31 neutralization, and HPV16 avidity than controls. No statistically significant differences by HPV18 antibody or HPV45 neutralization were observed among HPV45 cases and controls. Protection against HPV58 was not associated with any of the markers, confirming the specificity of our findings.Samples are from three-dose HPV vaccine recipients from the Costa Rica HPV16/18 vaccine trial. Women with a new HPV31, HPV45, or HPV58 infections over four years of follow-up were compared with randomly selected control women--with no new infection with HPV31/45/58--with respect to HPV16 and HPV18 antibody, HPV31, HPV45, and HPV58 neutralization, and HPV16 avidity.High HPV16 levels and avidity, and the ability to neutralize HPV31 were associated with protection against newly detected HPV31 infections, suggesting that the partial VE demonstrated for HPV31 is likely to be mediated at least in part through antibodies induced by HPV16/18 vaccination.Safety and immunogenicity of one dose of MenACWY-CRM, an investigational quadrivalent meningococcal glycoconjugate vaccine, when administered to adolescents concomitantly or sequentially with Tdap and HPV vaccines.This Phase III study evaluates an investigational quadrivalent meningococcal CRM(197) conjugate vaccine, MenACWY-CRM (Novartis Vaccines), when administered concomitantly or sequentially with two other recommended adolescent vaccines; combined tetanus, reduced diphtheria and acellular pertussis (Tdap), and human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine. In this single-centre study, 1620 subjects 11-18 years of age, were randomized to three groups (1:1:1) to receive MenACWY-CRM concomitantly or sequentially with Tdap and HPV. Meningococcal serogroup-specific serum bactericidal assay using human complement (hSBA), and antibodies to Tdap antigens and HPV virus-like particles were determined before and 1 month after study vaccinations. Proportions of subjects with hSBA titres > or =1:8 for all four meningococcal serogroups (A, C, W-135, Y) were non-inferior for both concomitant and sequential administration. Immune responses to Tdap and HPV antigens were comparable when these vaccines were given alone or concomitantly with MenACWY-CRM. All vaccines were well tolerated; concomitant or sequential administration did not increase reactogenicity. MenACWY-CRM was well tolerated and immunogenic in subjects 11-18 years of age, with comparable immune responses to the four serogroups when given alone or concomitantly with Tdap or HPV antigens. This is the first demonstration that these currently recommended adolescent vaccines could be administered concomitantly without causing increased reactogenicity.Pooled analysis of large and long-term safety data from the human papillomavirus-16/18-AS04-adjuvanted vaccine clinical trial programme.The purpose of this study is to further evaluate the safety of the human papillomavirus (HPV)-16/18-AS04-adjuvanted vaccine (HPV-16/18-vaccine Cervarix®, GlaxoSmithKline, Belgium) through a pooled analysis of data from 42 completed/ongoing clinical studies.Unsolicited adverse events (AEs) were reported for 30 days after each dose. Medically significant conditions, serious AEs (SAEs), potential immune-mediated diseases (pIMDs) and pregnancy outcomes were captured until study completion. Events leading to subject withdrawal were reviewed. Relative risks compared incidences of spontaneous abortion and pIMDs in controlled studies.Thirty one thousand one hundred seventy-three adolescent girls/women received HPV-16/18-vaccine alone (HPV group), 2166 received HPV-16/18-vaccine coadministered with another vaccine and 24 241 were controls. Mean follow-up was 39 months (range 0-113.3). Incidences of unsolicited AEs reported within 30 days after any dose were similar between HPV and Control groups (30.8%/29.7%). During the entire study period, reports of medically significant conditions (25.0%/28.3%) and SAEs (7.9%/9.3%) were also similarly distributed between groups. Deaths were rare: HPV (alone/coadministered) n = 25, controls n = 20 (n = 18 in blinded groups). pIMDs within 1 year were reported by 0.2% of HPV-16/18 vaccinees and controls. For each pIMD event category, no increased relative risks were reported for HPV-16/18 vaccinees versus controls. Coadministration did not change the overall safety profile. Pregnancy outcomes and withdrawal rates were similar between groups.Analysis of safety data arising from 57 580 subjects and 96 704 HPV-16/18-vaccine doses shows that the incidences and distribution of AEs were similar among HPV-16/18-vaccine recipients and controls. No new safety signals were identified. The data confirm previous findings that HPV-16/18-vaccine has an acceptable benefit-risk profile in adolescent girls and adult women.Preventive innovation: an Australian case study on HPV vaccination.Much of the literature has been conducted on innovation; this research provides new insights for preventive innovations that increase our understanding of vaccination diffusion and the reasons underlying the complexity of preventive diffusion. The research uses adoption of Rogers' ( 1983 ) perceived characteristics and considers the rate by which a product diffuses in a market. Qualitative empirical evidence collected via focus groups is used to identify human papillomavirus vaccine issues against the salience of perceived characteristics. Several impediments are identified and the application of marketing strategies is suggested for preventive innovations to improve the diffusion process and for designing proactive adoption. Immunogenicity and safety of human papillomavirus (HPV)-16/18 AS04-adjuvanted vaccine in healthy boys aged 10-18 years.The human papillomavirus (HPV)-16/18 AS04-adjuvanted vaccine (Cervarix) has been shown to be well-tolerated and immunogenic in females aged 10 to 55 years, and up to 100% effective for the prevention of HPV-16/18 infection and associated precancerous cervical lesions in females aged 15 to 25 years. This study is the first to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of the vaccine in males.Healthy males aged 10 to 18 years were randomized (2:1 ratio) to receive HPV-16/18 AS04-adjuvanted vaccine (n = 181) or hepatitis B virus (HBV) control vaccine (n = 89) at 0, 1, and 6 months, and were followed for 7 months.All initially seronegative subjects in the HPV-16/18 group seroconverted for HPV-16 and 18 (ELISA) at month 2. At month 7, all subjects were seropositive, and the HPV-16 and -18 antibody levels were, respectively, four- and twofold higher than at month 2. The anti-HPV-16 and -18 antibody responses for males aged 10 to 18 years and 10 to 14 years, respectively, were higher than those reported for females aged 15 to 25 years and 10 to 14 years, respectively, in a previous study. The reactogenicity profiles of the HPV-16/18 AS04 and HBV vaccines were similar, except that pain and swelling at the injection site were more common in the HPV-16/18 group. However, vaccine-related symptoms did not affect compliance with the three-dose course, which was equally high (97%) in both groups.The HPV-16/18 AS04-adjuvanted vaccine is immunogenic and well tolerated in boys aged 10 to 18 years. However, further data on the potential public health benefits of vaccination of boys are required before any recommendations can be made.Randomized trial of an alternate human papillomavirus vaccine administration schedule in college-aged women.Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine is effective against HPV types 16 and 18, which cause 70% of cervical cancers. The three-dose vaccination schedule at 0, 2, and 6 months may be inconvenient for college-aged women. This study assessed noninferiority of the immune response to an alternate vaccination schedule at 0, 2, and 12 months.Two hundred nonpregnant women, aged 18-23 years, with <5 sexual partners were randomized into standard and alternate schedules. Blood samples were drawn before dose 1 and 2-6 weeks after dose 3 and analyzed with the competitive Luminex immunoassay. Seropositives at baseline were eliminated from analyses by HPV type. Log-transformed titers were used to calculate HPV type-specific geometric mean titers (GMTs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for each group. Noninferiority was tested against a one-sided null hypothesis that the post-dose 3 GMT ratio of the alternate to standard schedule was < or =0.5 for each HPV type.One hundred eighty-eight women completed the study, with all 12 dropouts in the alternate schedule group (p < 0.001). Antibody responses in the alternate schedule were noninferior to the standard schedule for all vaccine types (p < 0.0001). Among the per-protocol population, GMTs (95% CI) for the alternate schedule were 4,440 (3,080-5,696), 5,688 (3,960-7,291), 12,443 (8,611-15,977), and 2,129 (1,183-3,063) for HPV types 6, 11, 16, and 18, respectively, vs. 2,153 (1,794-2,478), 1,966 (1,401-2,491), 6,218 (4,367-7,946), and 1,370 (1,167-1,553) for the standard schedule. Time between doses 2 and 3 significantly predicted final titer for all virus types (p < 0.005).For all HPV vaccine types, the GMT ratios indicated noninferiority of the alternate vaccine administration schedule at 0, 2, and 12 months. The alternate schedule may be used to expand options for the timing of the third dose in the HPV vaccine schedule.Evaluation of the immunogenicity of the quadrivalent HPV vaccine using 2 versus 3 doses at month 21: An epidemiological surveillance mechanism for alternate vaccination schemes.The cost of HPV vaccines and the need for 3 doses remains a barrier for their inclusion in routine vaccination schedules for girls in low and middle income countries. In a non-inferiority study, we aimed to compare the immunogenicity of a standard 3 doses and a 2 doses schedule. We enrolled 450 participants in an open-label non-randomized clinical trial to evaluate the immunogenicity induced at different ages by the licensed HPV6/11/16/18 quadrivalent vaccine in a 2 doses schedule (0-6 months, n = 150 girls aged 9-10 y) and 3 doses schedule (0, 2, and 6 months; n = 150 girls aged 9-10 y and n=150 women aged 18 to 24 years). To assess the antibody response, blood samples were obtained at Month 7 and 21 after the first vaccination from participants in all study groups. cLIA testing was performed at Merck Research Laboratories. Antibody levels were expressed as milli-Merck units (mMU) per ml. Primary outcome was non-inferiority (95% CI, lower bound >0.5) of the geometric mean titers (GMT) ratios for HPV6, HPV11, HPV16 and HPV18 antibodies 7 and 21 months after the first dose among girls receiving 2 doses compared with young women and girls receiving 3 doses. All vaccinees were seropositive for both HPV16 and HPV18 antibodies at month 7. At month 21, 98.5 and 56.6% of women 18-24 y old were seropositive for HPV16 and 18, respectively. For girls in the three doses group, seropositivity rates were 99.3 and 86.3% for HPV16 and 18, respectively. For girls in the two doses group rates were 99.3 and 70.2% for HPV16 and 18, respectively. The two doses schedule was non-inferior compared to the 3 doses schedule in same-age girls and to the group of adult women after 21 months of the first vaccine dose. Our results are in agreement with similar trials evaluating the immune response of a 2 doses schedule of both HPV vaccines, supporting the recent WHO recommendation as well as the Mexican policy to incorporate the 2 doses schedule for girls aged 9-11 y. Long-term follow-up observation of the safety, immunogenicity, and effectiveness of Gardasil™ in adult women.Previous analyses from a randomized trial in women aged 24-45 have shown the quadrivalent HPV vaccine to be efficacious in the prevention of infection, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and external genital lesions (EGL) related to HPV 6/11/16/18 through 4 years. In this report we present long term follow-up data on the efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of the quadrivalent HPV vaccine in adult women.Follow-up data are from a study being conducted in 5 sites in Colombia designed to evaluate the long-term immunogenicity, effectiveness, and safety of the qHPV vaccine in women who were vaccinated at 24 to 45 years of age (in the original vaccine group during the base study [n = 684]) or 29 to 50 years of age (in the original placebo group during the base study [n = 651]). This analysis summarizes data collected as of the year 6 post-vaccination visit relative to day 1 of the base study (median follow-up of 6.26 years) from both the original base study and the Colombian follow-up.There were no cases of HPV 6/11/16/18-related CIN or EGL during the extended follow-up phase in the per-protocol population. Immunogenicity persists against vaccine-related HPV types, and no evidence of HPV type replacement has been observed. No new serious adverse experiences have been reported.Vaccination with qHPV vaccine provides generally safe and effective protection from HPV 6-, 11-, 16-, and 18-related genital warts and cervical dysplasia through 6 years following administration to 24-45 year-old women.Clinicaltrials.govNCT00090220.Safety and immunogenicity of a vaccine targeting human papillomavirus types 6, 11, 16 and 18: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in Chinese males and females.In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 9-15 year old Chinese males (n=100) and 9-45 year old Chinese females (n=500) from Wuzhou, Guangxi, China were randomized (1:1) to receive either quadrivalent HPV vaccine or adjuvant-containing placebo. Blood samples were obtained at day 1 and one month post-dose 3 to determine the level of vaccine-induced antibodies. Among vaccine recipients, high antibody levels were observed for each of the four HPV types and seroconversion was >96%. The vaccine was generally well tolerated, with no vaccine-related serious adverse events. This study demonstrated that the quadrivalent HPV vaccine is highly immunogenic and generally well tolerated among Chinese males and females.Long-term immunogenicity and safety of the HPV-16/18 AS04-adjuvanted vaccine in 10- to 14-year-old girls: open 6-year follow-up of an initial observer-blinded, randomized trial.Immunogenicity and safety of the HPV-16/18 AS04-adjuvanted vaccine were evaluated up to 6 years postvaccination (month 72) in preteen/adolescent girls.Participants, who had received 3 HPV-16/18 AS04-adjuvanted vaccine doses at 10-14 years of age in an initial controlled, observer-blinded, randomized study (NCT00196924) and participated in the open 3-year follow-up (NCT00316706), were invited to continue the follow-up for up to 10 years postvaccination (NCT00877877). Anti-HPV-16 and -18 antibody titers were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays at yearly visits and were used to fit the modified power-law and piecewise models, predicting long-term immunogenicity. Serious adverse events (SAEs) and pregnancy information were recorded.In the according-to-protocol immunogenicity cohort, all participants (N = 505) with data available remained seropositive for anti-HPV-16 and -18 antibodies at month 72. In initially seronegative participants, anti-HPV-16 and -18 antibody geometric mean titers were 65.8- and 33.0-fold higher than those associated with natural infection (NCT00122681) and 5.0- and 2.5-fold higher than those measured at month 69-74 in a study demonstrating vaccine efficacy in women aged 15-25 years (NCT00120848). Exploratory antibody modeling, based on the 6-year data, predicted that vaccine-induced population anti-HPV-16 and -18 antibody geometric mean titers would remain above those associated with natural infection for at least 20 years postvaccination. The HPV-16/18 AS04-adjuvanted vaccine safety profile was clinically acceptable.In preteen/adolescent girls, the HPV-16/18 AS04-adjuvanted vaccine induced high anti-HPV-16 and -18 antibody levels up to 6 years postvaccination, which were predicted to remain above those induced by natural infection for at least 20 years.Human papillomavirus (HPV)-16/18 AS04-adjuvanted vaccine for the prevention of cervical cancer and HPV-related diseases.Vaccines are available against human papillomavirus (HPV), the causal agent of cervical and other cancers. Efficacy data from the HPV-16/18 AS04-adjuvanted vaccine clinical trial program were reviewed. Six randomized, controlled phase II/III trials evaluating cervical endpoints enrolled women from diverse populations and geographical locations. The program analyzed extensively the cohorts most relevant from a public health perspective: the total vaccinated cohort (TVC), approximating a general population including those with existing or previous HPV infection, and TVC-naïve, approximating a population of young women before sexual debut. Results show that the vaccine reduces HPV-16/18 infection and associated cervical endpoints in women regardless of age, location, or sexual experience. It provides cross-protection against some non-vaccine oncogenic HPV types and types causing genital warts, and may be effective against vulvar, oral, and anal HPV infection. Early epidemiology data following its introduction suggest a decline in the prevalence of vaccine and some non-vaccine HPV types. Sustained immunogenicity of the HPV-16/18 AS04-adjuvanted vaccine administered as a two-dose schedule in adolescent girls: Five-year clinical data and modeling predictions from a randomized study.In this randomized, partially-blind study ( clinicaltrials.gov ; NCT00541970), the licensed formulation of the human papillomavirus (HPV)-16/18 AS04-adjuvanted vaccine (20 μg each of HPV-16/18 antigens) was found highly immunogenic up to 4 y after first vaccination, whether administered as a 2-dose (2D) schedule in girls 9-14 y or 3-dose (3D) schedule in women 15-25 y. This end-of-study analysis extends immunogenicity and safety data until Month (M) 60, and presents antibody persistence predictions estimated by piecewise and modified power law models. Healthy females (age stratified: 9-14, 15-19, 20-25 y) were randomized to receive 2D at M0,6 (N = 240 ) or 3D at M0,1,6 (N = 239). Here, results are reported for girls 9-14 y (2D) and women 15-25 y (3D). Seropositivity rates, geometric mean titers (by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) and geometric mean titer ratios (GMRs; 3D/2D; post-hoc exploratory analysis) were calculated. All subjects seronegative pre-vaccination in the according-to-protocol immunogenicity cohort were seropositive for anti-HPV-16 and -18 at M60. Antibody responses elicited by the 2D and 3D schedules were comparable at M60, with GMRs close to 1 (anti-HPV-16: 1.13 [95% confidence interval: 0.82-1.54]; anti-HPV-18: 1.06 [0.74-1.51]). Statistical modeling predicted that in 95% of subjects, antibodies induced by 2D and 3D schedules could persist above natural infection levels for ≥ 21 y post-vaccination. The vaccine had a clinically acceptable safety profile in both groups. In conclusion, a 2D M0,6 schedule of the HPV-16/18 AS04-adjuvanted vaccine was immunogenic for up to 5 y in 9-14 y-old girls. Statistical modeling predicted that 2D-induced antibodies could persist for longer than 20 y. Spotlight on quadrivalent human papillomavirus (types 6, 11, 16, 18) recombinant vaccine(Gardasil®) in the prevention of premalignant genital lesions, genital cancer, and genital warts in women.Quadrivalent human papilloma virus (HPV) [types 6, 11, 16, 18] recombinant vaccine (Gardasil®; Silgard®) is composed of virus-like particles (VLPs) formed by self-assembly of recombinant L1 capsid protein from each of HPV types 6, 11, 16, and 18. The VLPs are noninfectious, containing no DNA, and are highly immunogenic, inducing high levels of neutralizing antibodies against the particular HPV types when administered to animals or humans. Quadrivalent HPV vaccine is indicated for use from the age of 9 years for the prevention of premalignant genital lesions (cervical, vulvar, and vaginal), cervical cancer, and external genital warts (condyloma acuminata) causally related to certain oncogenic or specific HPV types. In placebo-controlled clinical trials, quadrivalent HPV vaccine administered as three doses over 6 months provided high-level protection against infection or disease caused by the vaccine HPV types over 2-4 years of follow-up in females aged 15-45 years who were naive to the vaccine HPV types. A degree of cross-protection against certain other non-vaccine high-risk HPV types was also observed. The vaccine is not effective against current infection with a vaccine HPV type. Girls or women with current infection with one or more of the vaccine HPV types gained protection from infection or disease caused by the remaining vaccine HPV types and they were also protected against reinfection with the same HPV type after clearance of an infection caused by a vaccine HPV type. High seroconversion rates and high levels of anti-HPV antibodies were observed in all vaccinated individuals of all age ranges from 9 to 45 years. No correlation was found between antibody levels and protective efficacy of the vaccine. Rechallenge with quadrivalent HPV vaccine produced a potent anamnestic humoral immune response. The vaccine is generally well tolerated and is projected to be cost effective in most pharmacoeconomic models. Therefore, quadrivalent HPV vaccine offers an effective means, in combination with screening programs, to substantially reduce the burden of HPV-related precancerous lesions and cancer, particularly cervical cancer, as well as anogenital warts.Persistence of immune response to HPV-16/18 AS04-adjuvanted cervical cancer vaccine in women aged 15-55 years.The HPV-16/18 AS04-adjuvanted vaccine (Cervarix®, GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals) has been shown to induce a robust immune response in women aged 15-55 years (103514/NCT00196937). This follow-up study is the first report of persistence of immune response and safety profile through 48 months after vaccination in women aged 15-55 years. In this open-label, age-stratified Phase III study in Germany and Poland (105882/NCT00196937), healthy women aged 15-55 years received 3 doses of HPV-16/18 AS04-adjuvanted vaccine at 0, 1, and 6 months. Anti-HPV-16/18 seropositivity rates and geometric mean antibody titers (GMTs) were assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in women aged 15-25 (n=168), 26-45 (n=186) and 46-55 years (n=177) from the time of first vaccination through 48 months. At Month 48, all subjects were seropositive for anti-HPV-16 antibodies and 99.4% were seropositive for anti-HPV-18. Antibody kinetics were as previously reported, with peak response at Month 7 followed by a gradual decline tending towards a plateau in all age groups. Anti-HPV-16/18 GMTs were sustained at Month 48 in all age groups, including women aged 46-55 years in whom GMTs were respectively 11-fold and 5-fold higher than natural infection levels. The vaccine exhibited a clinically acceptable safety profile in all age groups. In summary, the HPV-16/18 AS04-adjuvanted vaccine induces high and sustained immune responses in women aged 15-55 years, with antibody levels remaining several-fold higher than natural infection levels for at least 4 years after the first vaccine dose.Comparative immunogenicity and safety of human papillomavirus (HPV)-16/18 AS04-adjuvanted vaccine and HPV-6/11/16/18 vaccine administered according to 2- and 3-dose schedules in girls aged 9-14 years: Results to month 12 from a randomized trial.This observer-blind study (clinicaltrials.gov NCT01462357) compared the immunogenicity and safety of 2 doses of the HPV-16/18 AS04-adjuvanted vaccine (HPV-16/18(2D)) vs. 2 or 3 doses of the HPV-6/11/16/18 vaccine (HPV-6/11/16/18(2D) and HPV-6/11/16/18(3D)) in healthy girls aged 9-14 y. Girls were randomized (1:1:1) to receive HPV-16/18(2D) at months (M) 0,6 (N = 359), HPV-6/11/16/18(2D) at M0,6 (N = 358) or HPV-6/11/16/18(3D) at M0,2,6 (N = 358). The primary objective was non-inferiority/superiority of HPV-16/18 antibodies by ELISA for HPV-16/18(2D) vs. HPV-6/11/16/18(2D) at M7 in the according-to-protocol immunogenicity cohort (ATP-I) and total vaccinated cohort, respectively. Secondary objectives included non-inferiority/superiority of HPV-16/18(2D) vs. HPV-6/11/16/18(3D) at M7, non-inferiority/superiority at M12, HPV-16/18 neutralizing antibodies, frequencies of T-cells/B-cells, reactogenicity and safety. Antibody responses at M7 for HPV-16/18(2D) were superior to those for HPV-6/11/16/18(2D) and HPV-6/11/16/18(3D) (lower limit of 95% confidence interval for geometric mean titer ratio (GMR) was >1): HPV-16/18(2D)/HPV-6/11/16/18(2D) GMRs were 1.69 [1.49-1.91] for anti-HPV-16 and 4.52 [3.97-5.13] for anti-HPV-18; HPV-16/18(2D)/HPV-6/11/16/18(3D) GMRs were 1.72 [1.54-1.93] for anti-HPV-16 and 3.22 [2.82-3.68] for anti-HPV-18; p = 0.0001 for all comparisons. Non-inferiority/superiority was also demonstrated at M12. Among initially seronegative girls in the ATP-I, neutralizing antibody titers were at least 1.8-fold higher for HPV-16/18(2D) vs. HPV-6/11/16/18(2D) and HPV-6/11/16/18(3D) at M7 and M12. Frequencies of HPV-16/18-specific T-cells and B-cells were in similar ranges between groups. Reactogenicity and safety were in line with the known profile of each vaccine. In conclusion, superior HPV-16/18 antibody responses were elicited by 2 doses of the HPV-16/18 AS04-adjuvanted vaccine compared with 2 or 3 doses of the HPV-6/11/16/18 vaccine in girls (9-14 years).Randomized controlled trial of two dosing schedules for human papillomavirus vaccination among college age males.Quadrivalent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine, for protection against sexually transmitted HPV infection, is licensed for females and males 9-26 years on a 3-dose schedule (0, 2, and 6 months; Standard schedule). Vaccine uptake has been low and catch-up vaccination of older adolescents using an alternate dosing schedule may increase coverage. This study tested the non-inferiority of the immunogenicity of an alternate dosing schedule (0, 2, 12 months) among college age males.220 18-25 year old males were randomly assigned to Standard or Alternate schedules. Blood samples were drawn immediately before Dose 1 and 2-6 weeks after Dose 3 and analyzed for antibody titers using a Luminex immunoassay. A value <1.5 for the upper 95% confidence interval (CI) bound of the Standard to Alternate schedule geometric mean titer (GMT) ratio was deemed non-inferior.Participants averaged 21.3 years old; 19.1% were non-white; completion rate was 93%. The anti-HPV titers for the Alternate schedule group were non-inferior to those of Standard schedule group for all four HPV vaccine virus types. Our results also demonstrated superiority of the Alternate schedule group for all four HPV vaccine virus types.A delayed third dose at 12 months is immunologically non-inferior and superior for four HPV virus types. Using an alternate dosing schedule offers more flexibility to receive the 3-dose HPV vaccine and may result in higher vaccination rates among college-age males.Immunogenicity and reactogenicity of alternative schedules of HPV vaccine in Vietnam: a cluster randomized noninferiority trial.Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine programs may decrease the morbidity and mortality due to cervical cancer seen among women in low-resource countries. However, the 3-dose schedule over a 6-month period is a potential barrier to vaccine introduction in such settings.To determine the immunogenicity and reactogenicity of different dosing schedules of quadrivalent HPV vaccine in adolescent girls in Vietnam.Open-label, cluster randomized, noninferiority study (conducted between October 2007 and January 2010) assessing 4 schedules of an HPV vaccine delivered in 21 schools to 903 adolescent girls (aged 11-13 years at enrollment) living in northwestern Vietnam.Intramuscular injection of 3 doses of quadrivalent HPV vaccine delivered on a standard dosing schedule (at 0, 2, and 6 months) and 3 alternative dosing schedules (at 0, 3, and 9 months; at 0, 6, and 12 months; or at 0, 12, and 24 months).Serum anti-HPV geometric mean titers (GMT) measured 1 month after the third dose of the HPV vaccine was administered; GMT was determined by type-specific competitive immunoassay. Noninferiority of each alternative vaccination dosing schedule was achieved if the lower bound of the multiplicity-adjusted confidence interval (CI) of the type-specific GMT ratio for HPV-16 and HPV-18 was greater than 0.5 (primary outcome). Safety outcomes were immediate reactions, local reactions, fever within 7 days after each dose, and serious adverse events up to 30 days following the last dose.In the intention-to-treat analysis, 809 girls who received at least 1 HPV vaccine dose had valid serum measurements 1 month after the third dose. After the third dose, the GMTs for those in the standard schedule group who received doses at 0, 2, and 6 months were 5808.0 (95% CI, 4961.4-6799.0) for HPV-16 and 1729.9 (95% CI, 1504.0-1989.7) for HPV-18; 5368.5 (95% CI, 4632.4-6221.5) and 1502.3 (95% CI, 1302.1-1733.2), respectively, for those whose received doses at 0, 3, and 9 months; 5716.4 (95% CI, 4876.7-6700.6) and 1581.5 (95% CI, 1363.4-1834.6), respectively, for those who received doses at 0, 6, and 12 months; and 3692.5 (95% CI, 3145.3-4334.9) and 1335.7 (95% CI, 1191.6-1497.3), respectively, for those who received doses at 0, 12, and 24 months. Noninferiority criteria were met for the alternative schedule groups that received doses at 0, 3, and 9 months (HPV-16 GMT ratio: 0.92 [95% CI, 0.71-1.20]; HPV-18 GMT ratio: 0.87 [95% CI, 0.68-1.11]) and at 0, 6, and 12 months (HPV-16 GMT ratio: 0.98 [95% CI, 0.75-1.29]; HPV-18 GMT ratio: 0.91 [95% CI, 0.71-1.17]). Prespecified noninferiority criteria were not met for the alternative schedule group that received doses at 0, 12, and 24 months (HPV-16 GMT ratio: 0.64 [95% CI, 0.48-0.84]; HPV-18 GMT ratio: 0.77 [95% CI, 0.62-0.96]). Pain at the injection site was the most common adverse event.Among adolescent girls in Vietnam, administration of the HPV vaccine on standard and alternative schedules was immunogenic and well tolerated. The use of 2 alternative dosing schedules (at 0, 3, and 9 months and at 0, 6, and 12 months) compared with a standard schedule (at 0, 2, and 6 months) did not result in inferior antibody concentrations.clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00524745.Immunogenicity and tolerability of an HPV-16/18 AS04-adjuvanted prophylactic cervical cancer vaccine in women aged 15-55 years.The immunogenicity and safety of an HPV-16/18 AS04-adjuvanted vaccine were assessed in women aged 26-55 years and compared with women aged 15-25 years in a Phase III, non-randomised, open-label, age-stratified study. Overall the vaccine was well tolerated and 100% seropositivity was achieved 1 month after the third dose in all age groups. There was a high correlation between HPV-16 and HPV-18 antibody levels (IgG) in cervicovaginal secretions and sera, regardless of age. The HPV-16/18 AS04-adjuvanted vaccine induces a robust and persistent immune response in women >26 years of age and generates antibodies that transudate through the cervix epithelium.Immunogenicity of 2 doses of HPV vaccine in younger adolescents vs 3 doses in young women: a randomized clinical trial.Global use of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines to prevent cervical cancer is impeded by cost. A 2-dose schedule for girls may be possible.To determine whether mean antibody levels to HPV-16 and HPV-18 among girls receiving 2 doses was noninferior to women receiving 3 doses.Randomized, phase 3, postlicensure, multicenter, age-stratified, noninferiority immunogenicity study of 830 Canadian females from August 2007 through February 2011. Follow-up blood samples were provided by 675 participants (81%).Girls (9-13 years) were randomized 1:1 to receive 3 doses of quadrivalent HPV vaccine at 0, 2, and 6 months (n = 261) or 2 doses at 0 and 6 months (n = 259). Young women (16-26 years) received 3 doses at 0, 2, and 6 months (n = 310). Antibody levels were measured at 0, 7, 18, 24, and 36 months.Primary outcome was noninferiority (95% CI, lower bound >0.5) of geometric mean titer (GMT) ratios for HPV-16 and HPV-18 for girls (2 doses) compared with young women (3 doses) 1 month after last dose. Secondary outcomes were noninferiority of GMT ratios of girls receiving 2 vs 3 doses of vaccine; and durability of noninferiority to 36 months.The GMT ratios were noninferior for girls (2 doses) to women (3 doses): 2.07 (95% CI, 1.62-2.65) for HPV-16 and 1.76 (95% CI, 1.41-2.19) for HPV-18. Girls (3 doses) had GMT responses 1 month after last vaccination for HPV-16 of 7736 milli-Merck units per mL (mMU/mL) (95% CI, 6651-8999) and HPV-18 of 1730 mMU/mL (95% CI, 1512-1980). The GMT ratios were noninferior for girls (2 doses) to girls (3 doses): 0.95 (95% CI, 0.73-1.23) for HPV-16 and 0.68 (95% CI, 0.54-0.85) for HPV-18. The GMT ratios for girls (2 doses) to women (3 doses) remained noninferior for all genotypes to 36 months. Antibody responses in girls were noninferior after 2 doses vs 3 doses for all 4 vaccine genotypes at month 7, but not for HPV-18 by month 24 or HPV-6 by month 36.Among girls who received 2 doses of HPV vaccine 6 months apart, responses to HPV-16 and HPV-18 one month after the last dose were noninferior to those among young women who received 3 doses of the vaccine within 6 months. Because of the loss of noninferiority to some genotypes at 24 to 36 months in girls given 2 doses vs 3 doses, more data on the duration of protection are needed before reduced-dose schedules can be recommended.clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00501137.Early assessment of the efficacy of a human papillomavirus type 16 L1 virus-like particle vaccine.A post hoc analysis was performed using combined data from two Phase I tolerability/immunogenicity studies of monovalent human papillomavirus type 11 (HPV11) or HPV16 L1 virus-like particle (VLP) vaccines. The goal was to determine if the HPV16 L1 VLP vaccine protected against HPV16 infection. Vaccine or placebo was given at 0, 2 and 6 months. HPV16 infection was defined by positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) results following vaccination. The incidence of HPV infection was observed to be 0 cases per 100 person-years at risk in the vaccine group, and 5 cases per 100 person-years at risk in the control group. These results support the institution of larger efficacy trials for HPV L1 VLP vaccines.Prophylactic efficacy of a quadrivalent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine in women with virological evidence of HPV infection.A quadrivalent (types 6, 11, 16, and 18) human papillomavirus (HPV) L1 virus-like-particle (VLP) vaccine has been shown to be 95%-100% effective in preventing cervical and genital disease related to HPV-6, -11, -16, and -18 in 16-26-year-old women naive for HPV vaccine types. Because most women in the general population are sexually active, some will have already been infected with > or =1 HPV vaccine types at the time vaccination is offered. Here, we assessed whether such infected women are protected against disease caused by the remaining HPV vaccine types.Two randomized, placebo-controlled trials of the quadrivalent (types 6, 11, 16, and 18) HPV vaccine enrolled 17,622 women without consideration of baseline HPV status. Among women infected with 1-3 HPV vaccine types at enrollment, efficacy against genital disease related to the HPV vaccine type or types for which subjects were naive was assessed.Vaccination was 100% effective (95% confidence interval [CI], 79%-100%) in preventing incident cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2 or 3 or cervical adenocarcinoma in situ caused by the HPV type or types for which the women were negative at enrollment. Efficacy for preventing vulvar or vaginal HPV-related lesions was 94% (95% CI, 81%-99%).Among women positive for 1-3 HPV vaccine types before vaccination, the quadrivalent HPV vaccine protected against neoplasia caused by the remaining types. These results support vaccination of the general population without prescreening.Comparison of the immunogenicity and safety of Cervarix and Gardasil human papillomavirus (HPV) cervical cancer vaccines in healthy women aged 18-45 years.This observer-blind study compared the prophylactic human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines, Cervarix (GlaxoSmithKline) and Gardasil (Merck), by assessing immunogenicity and safety through one month after completion of the three-dose vaccination course. Women (n = 1106) were stratified by age (18-26, 27-35, 36-45 years) and randomized (1:1) to receive Cervarix (Months 0, 1, 6) or Gardasil (Months 0, 2, 6). At Month 7 after first vaccination, all women in the according-to-protocol cohort who were seronegative/DNA negative before vaccination for the HPV type analyzed had seroconverted for HPV-16 and HPV-18 serum neutralizing antibodies, as measured by pseudovirion-based neutralization assay (PBNA), except for two women aged 27-35 years in the Gardasil group who did not seroconvert for HPV-18 (98%). Geometric mean titers of serum neutralizing antibodies ranged from 2.3-4.8-fold higher for HPV-16 and 6.8-9.1-fold higher for HPV-18 after vaccination with Cervarix compared with Gardasil, across all age strata. In the total vaccinated cohort (all women who received at least one vaccine dose, regardless of their serological and DNA status prior to vaccination), Cervarix induced significantly higher serum neutralizing antibody titers in all age strata (p < 0.0001). Positivity rates for anti-HPV-16 and -18 neutralizing antibodies in cervicovaginal secretions and circulating HPV-16 and -18 specific memory B-cell frequencies were also higher after vaccination with Cervarix compared with Gardasil. Both vaccines were generally well tolerated. The incidence of unsolicited adverse events was comparable between vaccinated groups. The incidence of solicited symptoms was generally higher after Cervarix, injection site reactions being most common. However, compliance rates with the three-dose schedules were similarly high (>or= 84%) for both vaccines. Although the importance of differences in magnitude of immune response between these vaccines is unknown, they may represent determinants of duration of protection against HPV-16/18. Long-term studies evaluating duration of efficacy after vaccination are needed for both vaccines.Immunogenicity of quadrivalent HPV vaccine among girls 11 to 13 Years of age vaccinated using alternative dosing schedules: results 29 to 32 months after third dose. Immune response to quadrivalent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine delivered at 0, 2, and 6 months in young adolescent females plateaus around 24 months after immunization. Antibody levels >24 months postvaccination using extended dosing schedules is unknown. We conducted a follow-up immunogenicity study of adolescent girls in Vietnam who participated in a noninferiority trial to investigate whether immune responses using 3 alternative dosing schedules (0, 3, 9 months; 0, 6, 12 months; or 0, 12, 24 months) are noninferior to the standard schedule at >2 years after immunization. Quadrivalent HPV vaccine immunogenicity delivered on 3 alternative dosing schedules was noninferior for types 6, 11, 16, and 18 at 32 months post-dose 3 compared to the standard schedule. Pre-dose 3 antibody levels for the 0, 12, 24 month schedule were similar to those measured 32-months post-dose 3. We found similar antibody concentrations ≥29 months after 3 doses of HPV vaccine regardless of dose-timing, and extended schedules do not produce inferior immune responses. Our findings also suggested that 2 doses of HPV vaccine delivered at 0 and 12 months might afford similar protection. Evidence supporting dosing flexibility could be important for national HPV vaccination policies.Vaccines against human papillomavirus in low and middle income countries: a review of safety, immunogenicity and efficacy.Currently, there is limited data on the immunogenicity and efficacy of human papillomavirus vaccines in Low and Middle income countries (LMIC). The review aims to summarize the current status from published HPV vaccine safety, immunogenicity and efficacy studies in low and middle income countries (LMIC). Electronic databases (PubMed/MEDLINE and HINARI) were searched for peer reviewed English language articles on HPV vaccination in LMIC that have so far been published from 1st January 2006 up to 30th January 2015. Eligible studies were included if they had used the bivalent (bHPV) or quadrivalent HPV (qHPV) vaccines in a LMIC and investigated safety, immunogenicity and/or efficacy. The main findings were extracted and summarized. A total of fourteen HPV vaccine studies assessing safety, Immunogenicity and efficacy of the bivalent or quadrivalent vaccines in LMIC were included. There are only ten published clinical trials where a LMIC has participated. There was no published study so far that assessed efficacy of the HPV vaccines in Sub-Saharan Africa. From these studies, vaccine induced immune response was comparable to that from results of HICs for all age groups. Studies assessing HPV vaccine efficacy of the bivalent or quadrivalent vaccine within LMIC were largely missing. Only three studies were found where a LMIC was part of a multi center clinical trial. In all the studies, there were no vaccine related serious adverse events. The findings from the only study that investigated less than three doses of the bivalent HPV-16/18 vaccine suggest that even with less than three doses, antibody levels were still comparable with older women where efficacy has been proven. The few studies from LMIC in this review had comparable safety, Immunogenicity and efficacy profiles like in HIC. Overall, the LMIC of Africa where immune compromising/modulating situations are prevalent, there is need for long term immunogenicity as well as surveillance studies for long term clinical effectiveness after two and three dose regimens. The impact of quadrivalent human papillomavirus (HPV; types 6, 11, 16, and 18) L1 virus-like particle vaccine on infection and disease due to oncogenic nonvaccine HPV types in sexually active women aged 16-26 years.We evaluated the impact of a quadrivalent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine on infection and cervical disease related to 10 nonvaccine HPV types (31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, and 59) associated with >20% of cervical cancers. The population evaluated included HPV-naive women and women with preexisting HPV infection and/or HPV-related disease at enrollment.Phase 3 efficacy studies enrolled 17,622 women aged 16-26 years. Subjects underwent cervicovaginal sampling and Pap testing on day 1 and then at 6-12-month intervals for up to 4 years. HPV typing was performed on samples from enrollment and follow-up visits, including samples obtained for diagnosis or treatment of HPV-related disease. All subjects who received 1 dose and returned for follow-up were included.Vaccination reduced the rate of HPV-31/33/45/52/58 infection by 17.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 5.1% to 28.7%) and of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 1-3 or adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) by 18.8% (95% CI, 7.4% to 28.9%). Vaccination also reduced the rate of HPV-31/58/59-related CIN1-3/AIS by 26.0% (95% CI, 6.7% to 41.4%), 28.1% (95% CI, 5.3% to 45.6%), and 37.6% (95% CI, 6.0% to 59.1%), respectively. Although a modest reduction in HPV-31/33/45/52/58-related CIN2 or worse was observed, the estimated reduction was not statistically significant.These cross-protection results complement the vaccine's prophylactic efficacy against disease associated with HPV-6, -11, -16, and -18. Long-term monitoring of vaccinated populations are needed to fully ascertain the population-based impact and public health significance of these findings.ClinicalTrials.gov identifiers: NCT00092521 , NCT00092534 , and NCT00092482.Randomized Open Trial Comparing 2-Dose Regimens of the Human Papillomavirus 16/18 AS04-Adjuvanted Vaccine in Girls Aged 9-14 Years Versus a 3-Dose Regimen in Women Aged 15-25 Years.This randomized, open trial compared regimens including 2 doses (2D) of human papillomavirus (HPV) 16/18 AS04-adjuvanted vaccine in girls aged 9-14 years with one including 3 doses (3D) in women aged 15-25 years.Girls aged 9-14 years were randomized to receive 2D at months 0 and 6 (M0,6; (n = 550) or months 0 and 12 (M0,12; n = 415), and women aged 15-25 years received 3D at months 0, 1, and 6 (n = 482). End points included noninferiority of HPV-16/18 antibodies by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for 2D (M0,6) versus 3D (primary), 2D (M0,12) versus 3D, and 2D (M0,6) versus 2D (M0,12); neutralizing antibodies; cell-mediated immunity; reactogenicity; and safety. Limits of noninferiority were predefined as <5% difference in seroconversion rate and <2-fold difference in geometric mean antibody titer ratio.One month after the last dose, both 2D regimens in girls aged 9-14 years were noninferior to 3D in women aged 15-25 years and 2D (M0,12) was noninferior to 2D (M0,6). Geometric mean antibody titer ratios (3D/2D) for HPV-16 and HPV-18 were 1.09 (95% confidence interval, .97-1.22) and 0.85 (.76-.95) for 2D (M0,6) versus 3D and 0.89 (.79-1.01) and 0.75 (.67-.85) for 2D (M0,12) versus 3D. The safety profile was clinically acceptable in all groups.The 2D regimens for the HPV-16/18 AS04-adjuvanted vaccine in girls aged 9-14 years (M0,6 or M0,12) elicited HPV-16/18 immune responses that were noninferior to 3D in women aged 15-25 years.NCT01381575.Immunogenicity and safety of human papillomavirus-16/18 AS04-adjuvanted vaccine coadministered with tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis vaccine and/or meningococcal conjugate vaccine to healthy girls 11 to 18 years of age: results from a randomized open trial.A combined immunization strategy for administration of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine with other routine vaccines may lead to better compliance. Reactions and immunologic interference with concomitantly administered vaccines are unpredictable, necessitating clinical evaluation.This was a randomized, open study conducted at 48 centers in the United States (NCT00369824). Healthy girls 11 to 18 years of age were randomized equally to 1 of 6 groups to receive 3 doses of HPV-16/18 AS04-adjuvanted vaccine administered at 0, 1, and 6 or 1, 2, and 7 months, with or without 1 dose of tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis vaccine (Tdap) and/or 1 dose of meningococcal polysaccharide diphtheria toxoid conjugate vaccine (MCV4) in different coadministration regimens (1283 girls vaccinated). Coadministered vaccines were injected at separate sites. Antibodies were measured for all vaccine components. Reactogenicity and safety were monitored.The prespecified criteria for noninferiority were met for all primary and secondary immunogenicity end points, demonstrating similar immunogenicity of Tdap and MCV4 when given alone or coadministered with the HPV vaccine. Immunogenicity of the HPV vaccine (in terms of seroconversion rates and geometric mean antibody titers to HPV antigens) was similar, regardless of whether it was given alone or coadministered with Tdap and/or MCV4. No differences were observed in the reactogenicity profile of the HPV vaccine administered alone or coadministered with either Tdap and/or MCV4 in different regimens.Concomitant administration of HPV-16/18 AS04-adjuvanted vaccine with Tdap and/or MCV4 in different regimens did not interfere with the immune response to any of the vaccines and had an acceptable safety profile.Immunogenicity and safety of the human papillomavirus 6, 11, 16, 18 vaccine in HIV-infected young women.The objective of this study was to determine whether the 3-dose quadrivalent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine series (HPV-6, -11, -16, -18) is immunogenic and safe in young women infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).We enrolled 99 women aged 16-23 years in a phase 2, open-label, multicenter trial, conducted from 2008 to 2011 by the Adolescent Medicine Trials Network for HIV/AIDS Interventions. Outcome measures were immunogenicity 4 weeks after dose 3, measured by (1) geometric mean titers (GMTs) and (2) seroconversion rates for HPV-6, -11, -16, and -18, among those seronegative and HPV DNA negative for each type. Immune responses were compared to those of a historical comparison group of HIV-negative women (n = 267) using univariate methods. Clinical and laboratory adverse events were assessed after each dose.The mean age of subjects was 21.4 years; 80% were non-Hispanic black, 69 were not taking antiretroviral therapy (ART), and 30 were taking ART. No differences in GMTs were noted among participants taking ART vs the comparison group, but GMTs were lower in participants not taking ART vs the comparison group for HPV-16 (2393 vs 3892 milli-Merck units per milliliter [mMU/mL], P = .012) and HPV-18 (463 vs 801 mMU/mL, P = .003). Seroconversion rates were 100% for HPV-6, -11, -16, and -18 among participants taking ART. Rates ranged from 92.3% (for HPV-18) to 100.0% (for HPV-6) among participants not taking ART. One severe adverse event (fatigue) was noted.In a sample of HIV-infected women who were HPV DNA and HPV seronegative, immune responses to HPV vaccination were generally robust and the vaccine was well tolerated.Evidence of immune memory 8.5 years following administration of a prophylactic human papillomavirus type 16 vaccine.The duration of protection conferred by prophylactic human papillomavirus (HPV) L1 virus-like particle vaccines is a critical determinant of their public health impact. A feature of vaccines that confer long-term immunity is their ability to induce immune memory.We evaluated antibody responses against HPV types 6, 11, 16 and 18 following administration of the quadrivalent HPV-6/11/16/18 vaccine to women who had previously received a monovalent HPV-16 vaccine.As part of an extended follow-up study conducted between 2006 and 2009 in Seattle, Washington, we administered the quadrivalent HPV-6/11/16/18 vaccine to 52 women (19 vaccine and 33 placebo recipients) who had participated in a monovalent HPV-16 vaccine trial 8.5 years earlier. Serum samples were tested for anti-HPV antibodies using competitive Luminex immunoassay.Following administration of the first dose of the quadrivalent HPV-6/11/16/18 vaccine, the anti-HPV-16 geometric mean titer among monovalent HPV-16 vaccine recipients (GMT=5024.0 milli-Merck units per milliliter [mMU/mL]; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2710.1, 9313.6 mMU/mL) substantially exceeded that among the placebo recipients (GMT=136.1; 95% CI: 78.5, 235.8 mMU/mL; p<0.01) and their own highest anti-HPV-16 response observed during the original trial (GMT at month 7 of the original trial=1552.7 mMU/mL; 95% CI: 1072.6, 2247.7 mMU/mL; p<0.01).The findings suggest that the administration of the three-dose regimen of the monovalent HPV-16 vaccine had produced memory lymphocytes, characterized by a heightened immune response following administration of the quadrivalent HPV-6/11/16/18 vaccine that effectively served as an antigen challenge.Overcoming barriers to HPV vaccination: non-inferiority of antibody response to human papillomavirus 16/18 vaccine in adolescents vaccinated with a two-dose vs. a three-dose schedule at 21 months.For middle and low-income countries, the cost of HPV vaccines remains challenging. We conducted an open-label nonrandomized clinical trial evaluating immune response to the HPV-16/18 AS04-adjuvanted vaccine administered on a standard (months (M) 0-1-6) versus extended schedule (M 0-6-60) at 7, 21, 60, 72 and 120 months post-vaccination. Participants were females recruited in Morelos, Mexico: 474 girls aged 9-10 years and 500 women aged 18-24 years receiving a standard schedule, and 1026 girls aged 9-10 years receiving an extended schedule (currently the girls in the extended schedule had received only the first 2 doses). This report presents the interim analysis results for non-inferiority between the regimes conducted with the current available data at 21 months after the first dose, with serum antibodies assessed by ELISA. A pre-stated margin of non-inferiority was defined by post-vaccination geometric mean titer (GMT) ratio (upper 95% confidence interval [CI]≤2.0) between the standard and the two-dose schedule in girls at month 21. Immune response to the vaccine was strongest in adolescent girls and in the 3-dose group. Statistical non-inferiority of the two-dose versus three-dose groups was demonstrated. At 21 months, comparing the adolescent 2-dose versus 3-dose groups, the GMT ratio and 95% CI were 1.66 (1.55-1.81) and 1.67 (1.51-1.86) for HPV16 and 18, respectively. The two-dose regimen was non-inferior when compared to the three-dose response in same-age girls and with women aged 18-24 years after 21 months of follow-up. The reduction in the number of doses from the current three-dose schedule may lower overall costs associated with the vaccination and increase accessibility and compliance with the recommended dosing of the HPV vaccine. Immunogenicity and reactogenicity of a novel vaccine for human papillomavirus 16: a 2-year randomized controlled clinical trial.To evaluate the immunogenicity, reactogenicity, and tolerability of a prototype human papillomavirus (HPV) 16 viruslike particle (VLP) vaccine directed against the L1 capsid protein.We enrolled healthy nonpregnant women aged 18 to 26 years into a 2-year, double-blind, dose-ranging multicenter trial (October 12, 1998, to September 30, 2001). Subjects were assigned to study groups to receive a 3-dose regimen (day 0, month 2, and month 6) of 1 of 4 vaccine doses: 10 microg, 20 microg, 40 microg, or 80 microg or placebo. Serum anti-HPV 16 L1 antibody (sL1Ab) geometric mean titers (GMTs) were measured at day 0, at month 3, at month 7, and every 6 months for a total of 2 years using a radioimmunoassay. The primary immunogenicity analyses evaluated GMTs at month 7 in L1Ab-seronegative subjects at baseline. Vaccine tolerability was also assessed.A total of 480 subjects were randomized to receive placebo (n=52) or 10 microg (n=112), 20 microg (n=105), 40 microg (n=104), or 80 microg (n=107) of HPV 16 L1 VLP vaccine. At baseline, 75% of subjects were L1Ab seronegative. All vaccine doses produced a statistically significant sL1Ab response vs placebo (P<.001). At the completion of the vaccination regimen, sL1Ab GMTs in baseline-seronegative subjects were 36- to 78-fold higher than the sL1Ab GMT at day 0 observed in subjects who had mounted an immune response to HPV 16 infection before enrollment. Serum L1Ab GMTs remained high throughout the 1.5-year postvaccination period. Postvaccination sL1Ab GMTs were 1.1- to 2.4-fold higher in women who had detectable sL1Ab levels at enrollment compared with those in baseline-seronegative subjects, particularly in the persistence phase. The vaccine was generally well tolerated with no statistically significant differences in injection site or systemic adverse experiences among treatment groups.Immunization with this novel HPV 16 L1 VLP vaccine was well tolerated and produced an immunogenic response that persisted for at least 1.5 years after the final dose.Evaluation of quadrivalent HPV 6/11/16/18 vaccine efficacy against cervical and anogenital disease in subjects with serological evidence of prior vaccine type HPV infection.In the quadrivalent (types 6/11/16/18) HPV vaccine (GARDASIL/SILGARD) clinical program, 73% of women aged 16-26 were naïve to all vaccine HPV types. In these women, prophylactic administration of the vaccine was highly effective in preventing HPV 6/11/16/18-related cervical disease. Of the remaining women, 15% of had evidence of past infection with one or more vaccine HPV types (seropositive and DNA negative) at the time of enrollment. Here we present an analysis in this group of women to determine the efficacy of the HPV 6/11/16/18 vaccine against new cervical and external anogenital disease related to the same vaccine HPV type which had previously been cleared. Vaccine tolerability in this previously infected population was also assessed.18,174 women were enrolled into 3 clinical studies. The data presented comprise a subset of these subjects (n = 2,617) who were HPV seropositive and DNA negative at enrollment (for >or=1 vaccine type). In each study, subjects were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive HPV 6/11/16/18 vaccine or placebo at day 1, month 2 and month 6 (without knowledge of baseline HPV status). Procedures performed for efficacy data evaluation included detailed genital examination, Pap testing, and collection of cervicovaginal and external genital specimens. Analyses of efficacy were carried out in a population stratified by HPV serology and HPV DNA status at enrollment.Subjects were followed for an average of 40 months. Seven subjects in the placebo group developed cervical disease, and eight subjects developed external genital disease related to a vaccine HPV type they had previously encountered. No subject receiving HPV 6/11/16/18 vaccine developed disease to a vaccine HPV type to which they were seropositive and DNA negative at enrolment.These results suggest that natural HPV infection-elicited antibodies may not provide complete protection over time, however the immune response to the HPV 6/11/16/18 vaccine appears to prevent reinfection or reactivation of disease with vaccine HPV types. Vaccine-related adverse experiences were higher among subjects receiving vaccine, mostly due to increased injection site adverse experiences.Safety of the HPV Bivalent and Quadrivalent Vaccines During Pregnancy.To evaluate the safety of the human papillomavirus (HPV) bivalent and quadrivalent vaccines in pregnancy.PubMed (1966-August 2010) was searched using the terms human papillomavirus, human papillomavirus vaccine, and pregnancy. References were reviewed for relevant information.All studies including humans that were published in English with data describing HPV vaccine administration in pregnancy were evaluated.Two combined analyses of 7 Phase 3 efficacy trials have retrospectively evaluated the safety of unintentional administration of either the bivalent (n = 1786) or quadrivalent (n = 2085) HPV vaccine during pregnancy. In addition, postmarketing pregnancy registry surveillance data (prospective, n = 787; retrospective, n = 76) for the quadrivalent HPV vaccine have been published. However, only 279 pregnancies from the studies and 90 pregnancies from the registry occurred within 30 days of receiving the vaccination. Overall, the vaccine does not appear to be associated with an increased risk of spontaneous abortion, fetal malformations, or adverse pregnancy outcomes beyond that found in the general population. Although the data are limited, neither HPV vaccine appears to be associated with an increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes. However, limitations of the data include small patient populations, minimal to no adjustments for factors known to influence pregnancy outcomes or malformations, and the majority of the available pregnancy data are from retrospective analysis of Phase 3 efficacy trials.Neither HPV vaccine should be routinely administered during pregnancy. If a pregnancy occurs midseries, the remaining vaccines should be given after pregnancy completion. Further studies are required to determine actual risk.Neutralization of non-vaccine human papillomavirus pseudoviruses from the A7 and A9 species groups by bivalent HPV vaccine sera.The majority of cervical cancers are associated with infection by one or more Human Papillomavirus (HPV) types from just two distinct Alpha-Papillomavirus species groups, A7 and A9. The extent to which the current HPV16/18 vaccines will protect against other genetically related HPV types is of interest to inform vaccine implementation, cervical disease surveillance and the development of second generation HPV vaccines. The aim of this study was to determine the frequency and titer of neutralizing antibodies against a range of A7 (18, 39, 45, 59, 68) and A9 (16, 31, 33, 35, 52, 58) HPV types using sera from individuals immunized with the bivalent HPV vaccine within the school-based, UK national HPV immunization programme. Serum samples were collected from 69 girls aged 13-14 years, a median 5.9 months (inter-quartile range, IQR, 5.7-6.0) after their third vaccine dose. Cross-neutralizing antibodies against HPV31, HPV33, HPV35 and HPV45 were common and strongly associated with the titer for the related vaccine-type, but were considerably lower (<1%) than their related vaccine type-specific response. The low prevalence of these HPV types in the population and the ages within the study cohort suggest these responses are due to vaccination. It is unclear whether such low levels of neutralizing antibodies would be sufficient to protect at the site of infection in the absence of other immune effectors but the coincidence with HPV types reported from efficacy studies is intriguing. The utility of neutralizing antibodies as surrogate markers of protection remains to be determined.Comparative immunogenicity and safety of human papillomavirus (HPV)-16/18 vaccine and HPV-6/11/16/18 vaccine: follow-up from months 12-24 in a Phase III randomized study of healthy women aged 18-45 years.In this observer-blind study (NCT00423046), women (N=1,106), stratified by age (18-26, 27-35, 36-45 y), were randomized (1:1) to receive the HPV-16/18 vaccine (Cervarix®, GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals, Months 0, 1, 6) or the HPV-6/11/16/18 vaccine (Gardasil® Merck & Co., Inc., Months 0, 2, 6). Month 7 results were previously reported; we now report Month 24 results. In the according-to-protocol cohort for immunogenicity (seronegative and DNA-negative at baseline for HPV type analyzed), seropositivity rates of neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) [pseudovirion-based neutralization assay] were, across all age strata, 100% (HPV-16/18 vaccine) and 97.5-100% (HPV-6/11/16/18 vaccine) for HPV-16, and 99.0-100% (HPV-16/18 vaccine) and 72.3-84.4% (HPV-6/11/16/18 vaccine) for HPV-18. Corresponding geometric mean titers (GMTs) were 2.4-5.8-fold higher for HPV-16 and 7.7-9.4-fold higher for HPV-18 with the HPV-16/18 vaccine versus the HPV-6/11/16/18 vaccine; HPV-16 and HPV-18 GMTs were significantly higher with the HPV-16/18 vaccine than the HPV-6/11/16/18 vaccine (p< 0.0001) in the total vaccinated cohort (received ≥1 vaccine dose, irrespective of baseline sero/DNA-status). Similar results were obtained using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Positivity rates and GMTs of antigen-specific IgG antibodies in cervicovaginal secretions (ELISA) were not significantly different between vaccines. At Month 24, CD4⁺ T-cell responses for HPV-16 and HPV-18 were higher with the HPV-16/18 vaccine; memory B-cell response was higher for HPV-18 with the HPV-16/18 vaccine and similar between vaccines for HPV-16. Both vaccines were generally well tolerated. Although an immunological correlate of protection has not been defined, differences in the magnitude of immune response between vaccines may represent determinants of duration of protection.Safety and immunogenicity of the HPV-16/18 AS04-adjuvanted vaccine in HIV-positive women in South Africa: a partially-blind randomised placebo-controlled study.In developing countries, risk of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection may be increased by the high prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. We evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of the HPV-16/18 AS04-adjuvanted vaccine in HIV-infected women in South Africa. Asymptomatic HIV-positive women aged 18-25 years (N=120) were stratified by CD4⁺ T-cell count and randomised (1:1) to receive HPV-16/18 vaccine (Cervarix®; GlaxoSmithKline Vaccines) or placebo (Al[OH]3) at 0, 1 and 6 months (double-blind). HIV-negative women (N=30) received HPV-16/18 vaccine (open label). Anti-HPV-16/18 antibody and CD4⁺ T-cell responses, CD4⁺ T-cell count, HIV viral load, HIV clinical stage and safety were evaluated for 12 months. The safety and reactogenicity profile of the HPV-16/18 vaccine was comparable in HIV-positive and HIV-negative women. Irrespective of baseline HPV status, all HIV-positive and HIV-negative women who received the HPV-16/18 vaccine were seropositive for both HPV-16 and HPV-18 after the second vaccine dose (month 2) and remained seropositive for both antigens at month 12. Anti-HPV-16/18 antibody titres at month 12 remained substantially above levels associated with natural infection. The HPV-16/18 vaccine induced sustained anti-HPV-16/18 CD4⁺ T-cell responses in both HIV-positive and HIV-negative women. No impact of baseline CD4⁺ T-cell count or HIV viral load was observed on the magnitude of the immune response in HIV-positive women. In HIV-positive women, CD4⁺ T-cell count, HIV viral load and HIV clinical stage were unaffected by HPV-16/18 vaccine administration. In conclusion, the HPV-16/18 AS04-adjuvanted vaccine appears immunogenic and well-tolerated in women with HIV infection. Study ID: 107863/NCT00586339.Impact of an HPV6/11/16/18 L1 virus-like particle vaccine on progression to cervical intraepithelial neoplasia in seropositive women with HPV16/18 infection.The impact of a human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine on development of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2-3 or adenocarcinoma in situ (CIN2-3/AIS) in women with ongoing HPV16 or 18 infections prevaccination is reported. Seventeen thousand six-hundred and twenty-two women aged 16-26 were enrolled in 1 of 2 randomized, placebo-controlled, efficacy trials (Protocols 013 and 015). Vaccine or placebo was given at day 1, month 2 and 6. Women were tested for HPV6/11/16/18 DNA and antibodies at day 1. We focus on the subset of women who were seropositive and DNA positive to HPV16 or HPV18 prevaccination. Incidence is expressed as the number of women with an endpoint per 100 person-years-at-risk. In total, 419 vaccine and 446 placebo recipients were both seropositive and DNA positive to HPV16 or HPV18 prevaccination and had at least one follow-up visit. In Protocol 013, the incidence of HPV16/18-related CIN2-3/AIS among these women was 10.9 in the vaccine arm and 7.0 in the placebo arm (vaccine efficacy = -54.9; 95% CI: -181.7, 13.0). In Protocol 015, the incidence of HPV16/18-related CIN2-3/AIS was 5.5 in the vaccine arm and 6.2 in the placebo arm (vaccine efficacy = 12.2%; 95% CI: -29.8, 40.9). These data suggest HPV vaccination neither reduces nor enhances progression to HPV16/18-related high grade cervical lesions, and cervical cytology screening and corresponding management should continue as per local recommendations. Ultimately, population-based surveillance of vaccinated individuals beyond these clinical trials will be required to further address questions regarding the impact of vaccination in women exposed to vaccine HPV types before vaccination.Safety and persistent immunogenicity of a quadrivalent human papillomavirus types 6, 11, 16, 18 L1 virus-like particle vaccine in preadolescents and adolescents: a randomized controlled trial.Administration of a quadrivalent HPV-6/ 1/16/18 vaccine to 16- to 26-year-old women was highly effective in preventing HPV-6/ 1/16/18-related cervical/vulvar/vaginal precancerous lesions and genital warts. As the risk of acquiring HPV significantly rises after sexual debut, HPV vaccines should have the greatest benefit in sexually naive adolescents. We evaluated the tolerability and immunogenicity of quadrivalent vaccine in males and females 9 to 15 years of age through 18 months postenrollment.In this randomized, double-blind trial, 1781 sexually naive children were assigned (2:1) to quadrivalent HPV-6/11/16/18 vaccine or saline placebo administered at day 1 and months 2 and 6. Serum neutralizing anti-HPV-6/11/16/18 responses were summarized as geometric mean titers (GMTs) and seroconversion rates. Primary analyses were done per-protocol (subjects received 3 doses, had no major protocol violations and were HPV type-specific seronegative at day 1). Adverse experiences were collected by diary card.At month 7, seroconversion rates were > or =99.5% for the 4 vaccine-HPV-types. GMTs and seroconversion rates in boys were noninferior to those in girls (P < 0.001). At month 18, > or =91.5% of vaccine recipients were seropositive, regardless of gender. A higher proportion of vaccine recipients (75.3%) than placebo recipients (50.0%) reported one or more injection-site adverse experiences following any vaccination. Rates of fever were similar between vaccination groups. No serious vaccine-related adverse experiences were reported.In 9- to 15-year-old adolescents, the quadrivalent vaccine was generally well tolerated and induced persistent anti-HPV serologic responses in the majority of subjects for at least 12 months following completion of a three-dose regimen. The vaccine durability supports universal HPV vaccination programs in adolescents to reduce the burden of clinical HPV disease, particularly cervical cancer and precancers.Reduced prevalence of vulvar HPV16/18 infection among women who received the HPV16/18 bivalent vaccine: a nested analysis within the Costa Rica Vaccine Trial.Vaccine efficacy (VE) against vulvar human papillomavirus (HPV) infection has not been reported and data regarding its epidemiology are sparse.Women (n = 5404) age 22-29 present at the 4-year study visit of the Costa Rica Vaccine Trial provided vulvar and cervical samples. A subset (n = 1044) was tested for HPV DNA (SPF10/LiPA25 version 1). VE against 1-time detection of vulvar HPV16/18 among HPV vaccinated versus unvaccinated women was calculated and compared to the cervix. Prevalence of and risk factors for HPV were evaluated in the control arm (n = 536).Vulvar HPV16/18 VE (54.1%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 4.9%-79.1%) was comparable to cervix (45.8%; 95% CI, 6.4%-69.4%). Vulvar and cervical HPV16 prevalence within the control arm was 3.0% and 4.7%, respectively. Independent risk factors for vulvar HPV were similar to cervix and included: age (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.5 [95% CI, .3-.9] ≥28 vs 22-23]); marital status (aOR 2.3 [95% CI, 1.5-3.5] single vs married/living-as-married); and number of sexual partners (aOR 3.6 [95% CI, 1.9-7.0] ≥6 vs 1).In this intention-to-treat analysis, VE against vulvar and cervical HPV16/18 were comparable 4 years following vaccination. Risk factors for HPV were similar by anatomic site.NCT00128661.A randomized, observer-blinded immunogenicity trial of Cervarix(®) and Gardasil(®) Human Papillomavirus vaccines in 12-15 year old girls.The current generation of Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines, Cervarix® and Gardasil®, exhibit a high degree of efficacy in clinical trials against the two high-risk (HR) genotypes represented in the vaccines (HPV16 and HPV18). High levels of neutralizing antibodies are elicited against the vaccine types, consistent with preclinical data showing that neutralizing antibodies can mediate type-specific protection in the absence of other immune effectors. The vaccines also confer protection against some closely related non-vaccine HR HPV types, although the vaccines appear to differ in their degree of cross-protection. The mechanism of vaccine-induced cross-protection is unknown. This study sought to compare the breadth and magnitudes of neutralizing antibodies against non-vaccine types elicited by both vaccines and establish whether such antibodies could be detected in the genital secretions of vaccinated individuals.Serum and genital samples were collected from 12-15 year old girls following vaccination with either Cervarix® (n = 96) or Gardasil® (n = 102) HPV vaccine. Serum-neutralizing antibody responses against non-vaccine HPV types were broader and of higher magnitude in the Cervarix®, compared to the Gardasil®, vaccinated individuals. Levels of neutralizing and binding antibodies in genital secretions were closely associated with those found in the serum (r = 0.869), with Cervarix® having a median 2.5 (inter-quartile range, 1.7-3.5) fold higher geometric mean HPV-specific IgG ratio in serum and genital samples than Gardasil® (p = 0.0047). There was a strong positive association between cross-neutralizing antibody seropositivity and available HPV vaccine trial efficacy data against non-vaccine types.These data demonstrate for the first time that cross-neutralizing antibodies can be detected at the genital site of infection and support the possibility that cross-neutralizing antibodies play a role in the cross-protection against HPV infection and disease that has been reported for the current HPV vaccines.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00956553.Comparison of the immunogenicity and reactogenicity of Cervarix and Gardasil human papillomavirus vaccines in HIV-infected adults: a randomized, double-blind clinical trial.We compared the immunogenicity and reactogenicity of Cervarix or Gardasil human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines in adults infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).This was a double-blind, controlled trial randomizing HIV-positive adults to receive 3 doses of Cervarix or Gardasil at 0, 1.5, and 6 months. Immunogenicity was evaluated for up to 12 months. Neutralizing anti-HPV-16/18 antibodies were measured by pseudovirion-based neutralization assay. Laboratory tests and diary cards were used for safety assessment. The HPV-DNA status of the participants was determined before and after immunization.Ninety-two participants were included in the study. Anti-HPV-18 antibody titers were higher in the Cervarix group compared with the Gardasil group at 7 and 12 months. No significant differences in anti-HPV-16 antibody titers were found among vaccine groups. Among Cervarix vaccinees, women had higher anti-HPV-16/18 antibody titers compared to men. No sex-specific differences in antibody titers were found in the Gardasil group. Mild injection site reactions were more common in the Cervarix group than in the Gardasil group (91.1% vs 69.6%; P = .02). No serious adverse events occurred.Both vaccines were immunogenic and well tolerated. Compared with Gardasil, Cervarix induced superior vaccine responses among HIV-infected women, whereas in HIV-infected men the difference in immunogenicity was less pronounced.Long-term efficacy and safety of human papillomavirus vaccination.In this paper, we review the published evidence about the long-term efficacy of the available human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines and their safety profile. Two prophylactic HPV vaccines - bivalent (bHPV) and quadrivalent (qHPV) - are now available, and vaccination programs are being widely implemented, primarily targeting adolescent girls. Efficacy has been widely demonstrated for both vaccines. Since the risk of HPV exposure potentially persists throughout a woman's sexual life, vaccine duration of protection is critical to overall effectiveness. Interpreting the results of long-term efficacy studies for the two HPV vaccines can be puzzling, due to the heterogeneity of studies, different methods used in the assessment of immunogenicity, histopathological and virological end points, and statistical power issues. Moreover, an immunologic correlate of protection has not yet been established, and it is unknown whether higher antibody levels will really result in a longer duration of protection. Disease prevention remains the most important measure of long-term duration of vaccine efficacy. To date, the longest follow-up of an HPV vaccine has been 9.4 years for the bHPV vaccine. Long-term follow-up for qHPV vaccine goes up to 8 years. The vaccine continues to be immunogenic and well tolerated up to 9 years following vaccination. All randomized controlled clinical trials of the bHPV and the qHPV vaccines provide evidence of an excellent safety profile. The most common complaint reported is pain in the injection site, which is self-limiting and spontaneously resolved. The incidence of systemic adverse events (AEs), serious AEs, and discontinuations due to a serious AE reported in clinical studies are similar between the two vaccines and their control groups. In particular, no increased risk of autoimmune disease has been shown among HPV-vaccinated subjects in long-term observation studies. As these are crucial topics in HPV vaccination, it is important to establish systems for continued monitoring of vaccine immunogenicity, efficacy, and safety over time. Cross-protective efficacy of two human papillomavirus vaccines: a systematic review and meta-analysis.The extent of cross-protection is a key element in the choice of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine to use in vaccination programmes. We compared the cross-protective efficacy of the bivalent vaccine (HPV 16 and 18; Cervarix, GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals, Rixensart, Belgium) and quadrivalent vaccine (HPV 6, 11, 16, and 18; Gardasil, Merck, Whitehouse Station, NJ, USA) against non-vaccine type HPVs.We searched Medline and Embase databases, conference abstracts, and manufacturers' websites for randomised clinical trials assessing the efficacy of bivalent and quadrivalent vaccines against persistent infections (lasting ≥6 months) and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) associated with the non-vaccine type HPVs (types 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58). We included studies of participants who were HPV DNA negative before vaccination for all HPV types assessed. We assessed heterogeneity in vaccine efficacy estimates between trials with I(2) and χ(2) statistics.We identified two clinical trials (Females United to Unilaterally Reduce Endo/Ectocervical Disease [FUTURE] I and II) of the quadrivalent vaccine and three (Papilloma Trial Against Cancer In Young Adults [PATRICIA], HPV007, and HPV-023) of the bivalent vaccine. Analysis of the most comparable populations (pooled FUTURE I/II data vs PATRICIA) suggested that cross-protective vaccine efficacy estimates against infections and lesions associated with HPV 31, 33, and 45 were usually higher for the bivalent vaccine than the quadrivalent vaccine. Vaccine efficacy in the bivalent trial was higher than it was in the quadrivalent trial against persistent infections with HPV 31 (77·1% [95% CI 67·2 to 84·4] for bivalent vaccine vs 46·2% [15·3 to 66·4] for quadrivalent vaccine; p=0·003) and HPV 45 (79·0% [61·3 to 89·4] vs 7·8% [-67·0 to 49·3]; p=0·0003), and against CIN grade 2 or worse associated with HPV 33 (82·3% [53·4 to 94·7] vs 24·0% [-71·2 to 67·2]; p=0·02) and HPV 45 (100% [41·7 to 100] vs -51·9% [-1717·8 to 82·6]; p=0·04). We noted substantial heterogeneity between vaccine efficacy in bivalent trials against persistent infections with HPV 31 (I(2)=69%, p=0·04) and HPV 45 (I(2)=70%, p=0·04), with apparent reductions in cross-protective efficacy with increased follow-up.The bivalent vaccine seems more efficacious against non-vaccine HPV types 31, 33, and 45 than the quadrivalent vaccine, but the differences were not all significant and might be attributable to differences in trial design. Efficacy against persistent infections with types 31 and 45 seemed to decrease in bivalent trials with increased follow-up, suggesting a waning of cross-protection; more data are needed to establish duration of cross-protection.Public Health Agency of Canada.HPV vaccine against anal HPV infection and anal intraepithelial neoplasia.The rate of anal cancer is increasing among both women and men, particularly men who have sex with men. Caused by infection with human papillomavirus (HPV), primarily HPV type 16 or 18, anal cancer is preceded by high-grade anal intraepithelial neoplasia (grade 2 or 3). We studied the safety and efficacy of quadrivalent HPV vaccine (qHPV) against anal intraepithelial neoplasia associated with HPV-6, 11, 16, or 18 infection in men who have sex with men.In a substudy of a larger double-blind study, we randomly assigned 602 healthy men who have sex with men, 16 to 26 years of age, to receive either qHPV or placebo. The primary efficacy objective was prevention of anal intraepithelial neoplasia or anal cancer related to infection with HPV-6, 11, 16, or 18. Efficacy analyses were performed in intention-to-treat and per-protocol efficacy populations. The rates of adverse events were documented.Efficacy of the qHPV vaccine against anal intraepithelial neoplasia associated with HPV-6, 11, 16, or 18 was 50.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 25.7 to 67.2) in the intention-to-treat population and 77.5% (95% CI, 39.6 to 93.3) in the per-protocol efficacy population; the corresponding efficacies against anal intraepithelial neoplasia associated with HPV of any type were 25.7% (95% CI, -1.1 to 45.6) and 54.9% (95% CI, 8.4 to 79.1), respectively. Rates of anal intraepithelial neoplasia per 100 person-years were 17.5 in the placebo group and 13.0 in the vaccine group in the intention-to-treat population and 8.9 in the placebo group and 4.0 in the vaccine group in the per-protocol efficacy population. The rate of grade 2 or 3 anal intraepithelial neoplasia related to infection with HPV-6, 11, 16, or 18 was reduced by 54.2% (95% CI, 18.0 to 75.3) in the intention-to-treat population and by 74.9% (95% CI, 8.8 to 95.4) in the per-protocol efficacy population. The corresponding risks of persistent anal infection with HPV-6, 11, 16, or 18 were reduced by 59.4% (95% CI, 43.0 to 71.4) and 94.9% (95% CI, 80.4 to 99.4), respectively. No vaccine-related serious adverse events were reported.Use of the qHPV vaccine reduced the rates of anal intraepithelial neoplasia, including of grade 2 or 3, among men who have sex with men. The vaccine had a favorable safety profile and may help to reduce the risk of anal cancer. (Funded by Merck and the National Institutes of Health; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00090285.).Safety and immunogenicity trial in adult volunteers of a human papillomavirus 16 L1 virus-like particle vaccine.Studies in animal models have shown that systemic immunization with a papillomavirus virus-like particle (VLP) vaccine composed of L1, a major structural viral protein, can confer protection against subsequent experimental challenge with the homologous virus. Here we report results of a double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation trial to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a human papillomavirus (HPV) type 16 (HPV16) L1 VLP vaccine in healthy adults.Volunteers were given intramuscular injections with placebo or with 10- or 50-microg doses of HPV16 L1 VLP vaccine given without adjuvant or with alum or MF59 as adjuvants at 0, 1, and 4 months. All vaccine recipients were monitored for clinical signs and symptoms for 7 days after each inoculation. Immune responses were measured by an HPV16 L1 VLP-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and by an HPV16 pseudovirion neutralization assay. The antibody titers were given as the reciprocals of the highest dilution showing positive reactivity in each assay. All statistical tests were two-sided.The prevaccination geometric mean ELISA titer for six seropositive individuals was 202 (range, 40--640). All vaccine formulations were well tolerated, and all subjects receiving vaccine seroconverted. Serum antibody responses at 1 month after the third injection were dose dependent in recipients of vaccine without adjuvant or with MF59 but were similar at both doses when alum was the adjuvant. With the higher dose, the geometric means of serum ELISA antibody titers (95% confidence intervals) to purified VLP 1 month after the third injection were as follows: 10,240 (1499 to 69 938) without adjuvant, 10,240 (1114 to 94 145) with MF59, and 2190 (838 to 5723) with alum. Responses of subjects within each group were similar. Neutralizing and ELISA antibody titers were highly correlated (Spearman correlation =.85), confirming that ELISA titers are valid proxies for neutralizing antibodies.The HPV16 L1 VLP vaccine is well tolerated and is highly immunogenic even without adjuvant, with the majority of the recipients achieving serum antibody titers that were approximately 40-fold higher than what is observed in natural infection.Safety of human papillomavirus (HPV)-16/18 AS04-adjuvanted vaccine for cervical cancer prevention: a pooled analysis of 11 clinical trials.A pooled analysis of the safety of the human papillomavirus (HPV)-16/18 AS04-adjuvanted cervical cancer vaccine Cervarix (GlaxoSmithKline) was performed in a cohort of almost 30,000 girls and women aged > or =10 years, 16,142 who received at least one dose of the HPV-16/18 vaccine and 13,811 who received one of three controls [Al(OH)(3) or hepatitis A vaccine (720 or 360 EU)]. Data are available for a total of 45,988 vaccine doses. Solicited local and general symptoms were recorded for seven days after each dose. Serious adverse events (SAEs), pregnancies, medically significant conditions (MSCs) and new onset of chronic diseases (NOCDs), including new onset of autoimmune diseases (NOADs), were proactively monitored. Data were analyzed by vaccine group according to age (10-14, 15-25 and >25 years) and reporting period (months 0-7, months 7-12 and >month 12). Rates of solicited local and general symptoms were higher in the HPV-16/18 vaccine group than in the control groups. However, compliance with the three-dose schedule was high and did not differ between groups (93.4% for HPV-16/18 vaccine group versus 92.5% for pooled controls). No clinically relevant differences were seen between the HPV-16/18 vaccine and pooled control groups in rates of SAEs (2.8% versus 3.1%), MSCs (19.4% versus 21.4%), NOCDs (1.7% in both groups) or NOADs (0.4% versus 0.3%). Similarly, no differences in pregnancy outcomes or rates of withdrawals due to AEs or SAEs were observed between groups. In conclusion, analysis of this large database shows the HPV-16/18 AS04-adjuvanted cervical cancer vaccine to have a favorable safety profile in women of all ages.Safety and immunogenicity profile of human papillomavirus-16/18 AS04 adjuvant cervical cancer vaccine: a randomized controlled trial in healthy adolescent girls of Bangladesh.Bangladesh has the highest level of incidence and mortality rates due to cervical cancer among women. The prevalence of cervical cancer in Bangladeshi women is 25-30/100,000. Human papillomavirus is an important cause of cervical cancer. The study was conducted to assess the immunogenicity and safety profile of human papillomavirus-16/18 AS04-adjuvanted cervical cancer vaccines in healthy Bangladeshi girls aged 9-13 years. Procedure This was a randomized (3:1) controlled trial with two parallel groups, the vaccine and control groups, that included 67 participants in Bangladesh. Subjects were given GlaxoSmithKline human papillomavirus-16/18 AS04-adjuvanted cervical cancer vaccine (and controls no vaccine) at the first day of vaccination (Day 0), at 1- and 6-month schedule and followed up until 7 months. Blood samples were taken for human papillomavirus antibody at enrollment and 1 month post-schedule at Month 7 from both subjects and controls. Safety data were gathered throughout the study period.Fifty subjects received vaccine at Day 0, 1 month and 6 months. All subjects were initially sero-negative in the vaccine group, and developed sero-conversion for human papillomavirus-16 and -18 antibodies except for one at Month 7. Seventeen controls did not receive vaccine. Clients were followed up for serious medically important events and blood samples were taken for human papillomavirus antibody detection at Day 0 and Month 7. Sero-conversion was found in 97.5% of subjects and no sero-conversion was found in the controls. Bivalent human papillomavirus vaccine was generally well tolerated, with no vaccine-related serious adverse experiences.The human papillomavirus-16/18 AS04-adjuvanted vaccine was generally well tolerated and highly immunogenic when administered to young adolescent females and could be a promising tool for the prevention and control of cervical cancer in Bangladesh.
